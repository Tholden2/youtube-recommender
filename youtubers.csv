MrBeast,"215,000,000","37,902,939,862",769,Entertainment,2012,"Red Light
- [Mr. Beast] I've recreated every single set
from Squid Game in real life,
and whichever one of these 456 people survives the longest,
wins 456 grand.
(contestants cheering)
The first game we're gonna play is red light, green light.
They have 30 minutes to cross the red line
on the other side of the huge room.
So without further ado, green light.
(tense music)
Red light.
(gun shot)
Oh, oh.
And as you can see,
every single player has a device strapped to them,
that when they're eliminated, it pops.
Chris, you wanna have a chance at one?
- Red light.
(gun shot)
Oh, oh, no.
- I know for sure this guy moved.
Green light.
- Red light.
Oh yo, they're dropping.
Okay, now some people are getting out.
- You gotta get a better spot
for the next red light, right?
- Mmhmm.
- You're fine.
- 30 people have gotten out so far.
If they move right now, they're out.
They have to hold this position until we say green light.
And I can take all the time I want,
'cause we still have 23 minutes left.
- We gotta get a green light going.
This guy's doing a full squat.
- Green light.
Green light.
Oh they all stopped.
Red light.
(gun shot) Oh.
- I called it, I called it.
Oh no.
- Can you push my glasses up?
- Okay.
- Do it slowly though, be careful.
- Are you good?
- Yeah, perfect. - Okay.
Green light.
Red light.
You're still moving.
She was jogging over here.
We're gonna go see who's in the very back.
You are in dead last.
What's going on?
- I let the others clear the path for me.
- You literally haven't even moved.
- Well, a couple steps.
- We'll see if it pans out, green light.
Yellow, red light.
Oh, that we got her, the yellow light worked.
- Oh, that was diabolical to throw a yellow light out there.
- Since 067 was a big part of the show.
I'll let you say green light.
- [All] Green light.
- Red light, yo, it would be funny if she just got out.
As you can see, over 100 people have been eliminated.
Do the honors, Chandler.
- Green light, red light.
(gun shot)
- [Mr. Beast] Oh, that was a loud one.
- There it is, ay.
- Green light.
Red light.
Look how close they are to the finish line.
It is do or die for most of these people.
Everyone look up at the TV.
You have four minutes and 20 seconds left.
- Yeah, that's the number.
- Green light, red light.
We have our first two finishers over here.
- Lets go!
- Green light, red light.
- Yes sir, baby.
Yes sir, baby.
- [Mr. Beast] All right,
we have five people across the finish line now.
- [Chandler] You're all kind of screwed
if you don't run faster.
- Yep, you're right.
- Green light.
Red light.
- Only two minutes remain.
- Karl makes me way too nervous.
- Green light.
Red light.
- We have under one minute remaining.
Time's ticking, green light.
Red light.
You have stepped on the line, you are good.
You're good.
You're good.
- Lets go!
- Red light.
(gun shot)
It worked, it worked, we got em.
You're definitely out.
Dude, I knew that would work, green light.
Red light.
You're definitely, so many of you just got out.
- They gotta run faster.
- They've gotta, you gotta sprint.
- Green light.
Green light.
I'm not even gonna say red light,
I'm not saying red light.
Ah, its too late.
Too late.
(crowd cheering)
- Whoa.
- Holy crap.
- Congratulations on surviving red light green light.
(contestants cheering)
So if you look at this TV,
you'll see that only
(TV twinkling)
232 of you survived.
If you look above your head,
you'll see the $456,000 you're competing for.
And now let's move on to honeycomb.
Honeycomb
In honeycomb, everyone gets a needle,
and a cookie with a different shape on it,
and they have 10 minutes
to remove the shape from the cookie.
But if they break the shape, they're eliminated.
All right, so everybody I'm gonna need you to get
in the line in front
of one of these question marks.
(tense music)
Why did you pick this one?
- Just like, the middle.
- Basically you don't think it's umbrella.
- There's an umbrella?
- Did you even watch Squid Game?
- So many of these people are about to get out.
- Reveal shape number one.
(contestants cheering)
- Reveal the second symbol.
(contestants cheering)
Look at how hype they're getting.
If I was you, I'd be getting pretty nervous.
Reveal it!
(contestants cheering)
Chris, go for it.
- No!
- I know umbrella going home.
That's all I got to say.
- We got the circle. Thank God we didn't get the umbrella.
(tense music)
- You look pretty nervous over here.
Even though you got the star,
you're the main character.
so you have plot armor, you're fine.
Start the timer.
The challenge is underway.
You just hear them all scraping.
- I hate my life.
- I was taking it out of the tin,
and it just snapped in half.
- Lets see it.
- It's working.
(clock ticking)
- Take your time.
- You had an umbrella?
- Yeah. - Sorry bud.
- Look at this. We have a successful triangle.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Oh no.
- What Jimmy doesn't know is I brought a lighter,
and I'm gonna drop it for somebody.
- What, what, what?
- One and a half minutes remaining.
(Yoshi licking sounds)
- Let's get it, baby.
Yeah, yeah.
- Oh my gosh, this is the first perfect umbrella I've seen.
- Oh yeah, easy peasy.
- Whoo!
- Six, seven, okay, she passed.
She does have plot armor.
- [Woman] Almost there.
- So close, 30 seconds.
- Oh my God.
- Are you serious?
- Three, two, one.
Time is up.
- You did it?
You did the umbrella?
- And just like that,
all these players have been eliminated.
But don't worry because they're all walking away
with $2,000 in cash.
142 of you survived honeycomb.
(crowd cheering)
And if you leave in the next five minutes,
I'll give you $4,000.
Let's weed out some of the weak people.
$4,000.
- Thank you.
- I was not expecting this many people.
There we go, head on out.
And with that,
I'm gonna need you all to split up into groups of 10.
We had them form teams because next up is tug of war.
- This could determine your chance
at half a million dollars.
- We needed the strongest people and the smartest people.
We have intelligence, skill, and brawn.
- We trying to recruit the biggest people,
so we can get real strong and pull the rope.
- Sorry, no girls allowed.
- Oh, no girls allowed, boo, okay.
- I just sent three people off.
We got 10 now let's go.
- Let's go!
- I should have taken the four grand.
- We now have 12 different groups of 10 people.
Let's move on to the next game.
Tug Of War
And now let's decide who faces who?
(contestants cheering)
Okay, we're gonna draw one from here.
Six, we'll just draw this one.
Five, okay.
Follow me to the bridge.
And now the moment you've been waiting for.
A game of tug of war.
Team six versus team five.
- Team five on three.
One two, three, team five.
- You've fall in the foam, or your flag crosses
to the other team's side. You're eliminated.
Are you guys ready?
- [All] Yeah!
- Are you ready?
- [All] Yeah!
- All right, three, skip a few, go.
- Pull!
- Power!
- Oh, it's going to team five right now.
Team six is falling.
Somebody's right at the edge.
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
(crowd cheering)
- Congratulations, team five,
you have all moved on.
Team number two versus team number seven.
(team cheering)
They seem happy.
Team seven and two head on out.
- You keep me alive, we're gonna get the money.
(team cheering)
- Give it up, this team's winning.
- Go, oh, it's already on right side.
Hey, let's check in on 067.
In the show you won,
so let's see if it works here.
And Karl, we have 067.
You should just lose.
- Karl no, give them motivation.
- Pull!
- Its over here, it crossed.
(team cheering)
Sir, can you come over here?
Why don't you draw?
Don't look, grab one from here, and one from here,
and then grab one from here.
Team number four versus team number 10.
(team cheering)
If I was you guys, I'd be terrified,
'cause they have 456.
He's literally the main character.
- Let's go!
- Three, two, one, go.
Oh, they're getting, oh.
Oh, it's going over to 456.
They're falling.
They're dropping
They all just fell.
Obviously we have no way of rigging it,
but 456 and 067 both survived tug of war.
Let's draw, oh boy.
Nine versus 11.
(crowd cheering)
In this game with team nine versus team eleven,
they went so hard that this happened.
They are going all out, look at them.
Oh they're falling.
Don't let them.
Oh yes.
Oh, they broke the set.
They literally broke it.
You guys can move on.
Go ahead and head on now.
Marbles
Tug of war took us from 120 people down to 60.
And remember, only one of these people is walking away
with $456,000.
All right, everybody.
Can we have your attention?
As you guys know from Squid Games,
game number four is marbles.
(contestants cheering)
- I don't know if I'd be cheering,
because instead of letting you pick your partner,
we're gonna make you partner with your best friend.
Throughout this entire challenge,
we've been monitoring who you've been talking to the most,
and we're gonna make you partner up with them.
And only one of you can move on.
For example, 067 and 431.
- That's my best friend.
- According to this, you two are roommates and best friends.
We did our research.
- I have to come home to the house we live in
at the end of the day,
gonna be a bit awkward.
- Wouldn't be able to do it without you, man.
- We couldn't have done it without each other.
- I'm glad I'm with you at the end.
Elimination
- [Mr. Beast] Everybody gets a bag of 10 marbles,
and they have to agree on a game to play it
against their best friend.
20 marbles lets them move on.
But by winning, they eliminate their best friend.
Go ahead and start the timer.
You can play whatever game you want,
but you need 20 to leave.
A lot of pairs went with marble games
that were played in Squid Game.
- Odd.
- Even.
- Odd or even?
- Even on that side.
- What?
What game are you playing?
- We don't know.
One marble at a time, it's gonna take all day.
- If you keep talking, it might.
- Okay.
- [Mr. Beast] And other groups got creative.
- What is this game?
- We're throwing it at the bricks, right?
If you get the middle one right there, that's one point.
But if you hit the bricks in the behind,
then its three points.
Everything else is no points until the clock runs down,
Whoever has most points is the winner.
- All right, well good luck with your game.
- But one group just wanted to get it over with.
You're doing even odds for all of it.
Yo, he looks so intense.
- He's got one marble.
- Are you sure?
- Oh, he got it, oh my gosh.
Congratulations on winning.
I'll see you in the next round.
- You're good buddy, you're good, okay?
- I'm so sad.
- Why are you sad?
It's gonna be okay.
- We promised each other we were not gonna
screw each other over.
I didn't even know we were gonna be this close.
- I'm doing this for my family, but I'm nervous.
- Best man's gonna win.
- Best man win man.
- Best man's gonna win.
- [Mr. Beast] Everybody, you've got five minutes left.
- Don't look at me.
- They want to put $465,000 Up to a coin flip.
- You had to make it sound like that, huh?
Tails.
- It's tails.
- Yo, oh no.
- Odd?
- I'll give you the honor of eliminating your best friend.
- Oh no, that's even worse.
- Ah.
- Aww.
- It doesn't hurt.
Before I eliminate you,
I wanna let the viewers know that someone random
that subscribes in the next seven days is getting $10,000.
So if you haven't already, hit the subscribe button okay?
- Can I do it?
- Go for it. Just hit right there.
- Oh.
- Don't fall, they're so dramatic.
So if you haven't already subscribe
and you could win 10 grand.
What game are we playing?
- Closest to the wall.
- A minute and 15 seconds remain.
When that hits zero, if you're in here,
you're eliminated.
- I have one more question to ask.
- What's up, man?
- You promise to remember me?
- Oh my gosh.
- What do you mean?
- You're literally both about to get eliminated.
Oh, what was that?
- Why'd you do that?
- You sure? - Yeah.
- He has been eliminated, thank you, sir.
- I love you, man.
- The time has hit zero.
Everyone in here is eliminated.
Congratulations on surviving marbles.
At this point in the real show,
there was an all out brawl to thin the numbers.
So instead we're gonna play Ddakji.
You have to use this blue piece of paper
to flip that red one on the ground by throwing it.
The first 16 of you to flip your red square
moves on to glass bridge,
which is personally my favorite game.
Everyone throw.
Oh wow, we didn't even get anyone.
And while they're fighting for their chance
in this competition, I wanna tell you guys
about Brawl Stars,
who helped fund this video,
which cost over three and a half million dollars.
Thank you so much.
Throw.
- Yes!
- Brawl Stars is a mobile game you can play at home,
on the go, in this arena, wherever you want
against millions of people across the world.
Oh, we got some.
Congratulations.
It's three minutes of adrenaline filled mayhem,
and they have 12 different game modes,
including their own battle Royale,
which is kind of similar to what we're doing here.
- Yes! - Yes!
- Yeah, let's go.
- We have nine winners so far,
which means only seven places remain.
You said you played Brawl Stars?
- We both do.
- Oh, you both play Brawl Stars?
What are your thoughts on Brawl Stars?
- That it's pretty fun.
It's a mobile game, you can download it on Android or Apple.
- I didn't tell him to say this.
- Lets go!
- Yeah!
- Yo, the main characters survived.
As you can see,
you see the Brawl Stars logo, he did it.
They have over 50 different characters you can play as,
from a vintage driven robot to a cactus named spike,
that kind of looks like Nolan.
- Hey.
- And like all our contestants here are leaving
with $2,000 for free today.
Every single person that plays Brawl Stars
within the next seven days,
I will personally be giving you a free prize.
So if you haven't already, go download it.
If you yell ""Thank you, Brawl Stars.""
Before you throw, I hear you'll flip it.
- [Contestants] Thank you Brawl Stars!
- Oh, it worked for him.
- Oh my God, it's true.
- Thank you, Brawl Stars.
- And for the 14 of you that didn't flip it,
I'm gonna have to eliminate you.
Oh, that was so in sync, oh my gosh.
Now can all of you winners turn around.
Thank you, and now you can turn around again.
We just filled the room with 16 different mannequins,
and here's the thing.
They're actually in a random order.
And the numbers on them are in Korean.
And the number they get here
is what order they have to cross in glass bridge.
In a timely and orderly fashion. You can all go.
First come, first serve.
What'd you get?
Oh, she got one.
Oh.
- 15, okay.
- All right, if you wanna just go ahead and leave now.
Everyone has a vest with numbers, let's go to glass bridge.
Glass Bridge
We are now at the glass bridge set,
and look at how insane this thing looks.
It is amazing.
And bring out the contestants.
I can't wait to see the look on their faces.
- [Contestant] Oh, what?
Oh my God.
- Players, welcome to glass bridge.
(contestants cheering)
There is two platforms you can jump on.
One will drop you, and one will hold you.
Start the timer.
Begin the challenge.
- Okay.
- Let's go, girl.
- I'm sticking with the guys I'm sticking with.
I'm sticking, I'm sticking.
- All right, she survived the first jump.
Okay, they are one for one so far.
- Go right?
- I'm always right.
- Okay.
- I don't know if I'd listen to Chris.
- Chris, this is on you.
- Hey, victory.
- We had our first loss.
If you're wondering where she just fell, don't worry,
there's a giant foam pit down there, she's fine.
Well now, now you know.
Now you know left.
- Come on, 13 Minutes guys.
- We now have three people on the platform.
Only one out so far.
- I'm not moving.
I want somebody past eight to take the next step.
- Past eight?
All right, I love that, yo.
- Hey. Three minutes has gone by.
- Is anybody willing to go?
Clock's ticking.
- [Mr. Beast] All right, let's see it.
(tense music)
- Come on, man.
You got this. - Come on, Ted.
- Yes.
- Now go two.
Now you go.

- Lets go, two.
Let's go, two.
Oh, you already knew that one.
- Oh, oh.
- Oh.
- You see how many I've gotten?
Take the next one.
- How many did you guess right?
- Three. - Three?
- Yeah. - Wow.
Yeah, honestly it's time someone else steps up.
- Hey every second somebody doesn't step up,
that's less time you got.
- Hey, if no one crosses, I just keep the money.
- All right, three went for it.
- Three just got eliminated.
All right, two, he took the L for you.
- Adio time two.
- Hey honestly, hey two, if you're three for three,
you might as well keep going.
Clearly, you're lucky.
- Oh my God, all right.
- [Mr. Beast] No pushing, obviously, please.
- Come on.
- Two bit the bullet.
- Two's gone.
- Under eight minutes.
You've still got a ton of ground to cover.
- Yeah, he's good.
- I don't understand why number 10 went
in front of everyone.
That was dumb.
- Come on buddy.
- Yo did 10 make it again?
- All right, it looks like number four is gonna go.
- Six minutes remaining.
- I'm doing this for the girls.
- Let's salute all the fallen people.
All right, continue.
Under five minutes left.
Tons of jumps.
This is gonna get intense.
- Oh, that was crazy.
- No ten's gone, no.
- [Mr. Beast] Another one gone.
- All right, don't move bud, don't move.
- I'm not moving.
- Your odds don't look back there right now.
- Nah, I'm not moving.
I'm not moving.
- All right, just like we thought would happen,
They're refusing to move.
Let's see who budges.
- I'm pretty good where I am.
- Lets go.
- You got it.
- Oh, he got it.
- All right, no, not a chance, come on.
- When are y'all big numbers taking a chance?
- Under three minutes with four jumps left.
- Somebody's gonna have to do it.
Y'all are in a real bad spot.
I'm not moving.
- What are y'all big numbers taking a leap of faith?
- Hey, how are you doing back there, 15?
- Whatever, man, we could all lose.
- You guys better hurry up.
- They have two minutes, why are they not rushing?
- If you go, I'll take the next one.
- All right. - Come on.
- You jumping?
- Y'all really got me scared,
but hold up bro.
This is a real life decision.
- 90 seconds, one and a half minutes.
- Come on now, come on, come on, come on.
- Six.
- Jump, jump, jump.
Oh, you passed.
- I ain't moving, I am not moving.
Y'all, there's a God telling me I'm not moving.
- One minute remaining.
Three jumps, one minute.
Hey, you guys in the back,
if you're not here when it hits zero, you're gone.
- I took my leap of faith,
now I'm gonna stay right here and be cozy.
- Hurry, go.
- Y'all go.
- [Mr. Beast] It's just three.
(All clamoring)
- Take a leap of faith, come on, come on.
- You're up.
- I can't jump, they're in my way.
They're in my way.
- They're all crowded on that one.
- Hey, 30 seconds.
- Go, go.
- Go, take a leap of faith.
Go, go, go.
- One more jump.
20 seconds.
One more jump.
- I already jumped,
I'm not jumping I'm not jumping.
- 10, nine, eight, seven, six.
- Someone go.
- Let me go watch the replay real quick.
I'm gonna play the footage and slowmo for the viewers.
As you can see,
the timer is on zero and there were four people
still clearly on the platforms when the timer hit zero.
The four people were 16, eight, 13, and five.
All right, so the four losers, can you jump off?
Just jump, you're eliminated, you're eliminated.
You're eliminated, get outta here.
Thank you for coming out.
And all of you are moving onto the final game.
They're competing for $456,000, let's go.
Final Game
Congratulations on making it to the top six.
To celebrate, we made you all steak dinners.
Now, unlike the show, this isn't a real knife,
this is plastic.
But, you do have steak.
Everyone make sure you eat up,
so you have plenty of energy for this final game.
- I'm thinking about winning all of that money right now.
I'm probably give most of it to my family, friends.
- That money's coming home with me,
giving $100K straight to my mama.
- I'm feeling great, it's just blessed to be here.
- I'm gonna pull through,
I'm definitely donating about 10,000 to TEAMSEAS,
which all of you should if you have the means.
- I won't fold under no pressure.
I'm not worried about none of these five.
Ain't nobody got nothing on me, so I'm good.
- You wanna just go settle this with the final game?
- Let's do it. - Yeah, let's do it.
- Let's do it.
- Welcome to the final game of Beast Games.
So I think you guys can piece together
what we're about to play.
- Musical chairs.
- Musical chairs, yeah.
Let's test my hypothesis,
raise your hand if you know how to play Squid Game.
Exactly, that's why we're doing musical chairs instead,
because we're not Korean, start circling.
Start the music.
Karl, you can stop it whenever you want.
Karl do not look.
Chris, don't look.
Karl isn't looking so we can't be biased.
All right, let's see what happens.
Oh, oh he got it.
- I got more, man.
I'm pretty sure. - He's way more.
I'm sorry about that.
Oh no.
- Sorry bro.
- Bring the coffin over here.
Hop on in the coffin.
He has officially been eliminated, and five remain.
This chair is now gone.
Karl, start the music.
(ominous music) Okay.
You have full...
Oh, hold on, hold on.
No more moving, come over here.
No why'd you get up?
- Nah, he had it.
He had it.
- At least he is honest.
Oh my gosh.
And while they're coffining him up, play the music.
(ominous music) Okay.
The music has begin.
$456,000 on the line.
- It's about to happen at any second.
- Oh man, oh, you sat.
Oh no.
- He sat early, he sat early.
- Karl did not stop the music.
Bring out the coffin, I'm gonna have to pop you.
Man, that's such a sad way to go out.
- It was a great journey, I loved it.
It was so fun.
- Hop on in the coffin.
All right. Now you can't say this is scripted.
Good luck.
(ominous music) Okay.
The music has started.
Three people, two chairs.
One must go.
Keep it moving now.
You gotta keep moving.
Gotta keep moving.
Oh no.
- Yes!
- They were against me.
They were against me bruh. - Oh my God.
- They plotted on me.
- You have been eliminated.
Open up the coffin.
Thank you for coming out, man.
- No problem. - I loved your energy.
at the start of this video, we had 456 people.
Now we're down to these two.
- Yeah! - Yeah!
- Okay, I'm gonna take this chair right here.
You guys gotta keep moving the entire time.
No stopping and hovering.
This will determine which one of you wins 456 grand,
Karl, kick the music on.
(ominous music) Hey, let it play
a little bit, Karl.
Lets let them soak in it.
Karl's not looking at them.
He has no idea where they are on the chair.
- Somebody's gonna get $456,000 because you pause the music.
- Oh boy.
Oh, this is, oh the intensity.
When will he pause it?
When's he gonna pause it?
- Yo, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Oh, my God!
- If it makes you feel better,
I'm gonna give you $10,000 for coming in second place.
- Oh, you're kidding me. - No.

and officially won the very first
Squid Game in real life ever.

So that's what I'm going to try and do...
Aahh!

unleash a black hole equivalent to 1
million tnt there's no way we're gonna

frame at a time but it looks like it's
coming towards carl and chandler no
i'm not even on the thingy anymore look
at this tnt creator get me out get me

chris is the only one that's died
apparently a minecraft server can't
handle 10 million tnt hello there carl
hi you and chandler were both alive when
the server crashed and we need to decide
who gets the ten thousand dollars in
this duffel bag sure i'll take it if you
select the split block and chandler
to split block you both get five
grand if you select split and he selects
steel he gets the 10 grand and if you
both pick steel neither of you get it
yeah what you gonna do do you trust
chandler place your decision right here
really right now place your decision
which is it
i i have faith in him so you're gonna
split it i trust him honestly do you
think carl chose to split it with you or
steal it from you he's so sneaky i
thought you guys were friends though
what if he put a green block down and
you put a red block down and just took
the 10 grand for yourself
okay oh let's do it before we tear down
the wall what do you think chandler
picked carl i don't know i believe in
him server dropped the walls
carl i'm sorry
but chandler stole 10 dollars from you
nerd
chris misled me i was easily influenced

snack

why they're there but I have a funny
feeling that they need help judging by
all the blood so I'm going to go help
them hi Oh I thought it was going to
beat I thought that I was going to
actually go into the game right then and
there but I
didn't oh done oh hi what is
this read mysterious brutal incident man
found cut in half with no
clues
aikawa Japan a man was found with his
body cut in half near the stationary of
asahikawa city in a shocking incident
that has baffled the police the crime
scene was discovered by a passer by who
heard a strange noise Last Friday Night
the victim looked like he was chopped by
an Axe and blood was everywhere the
police sealed off the scenes and
investigated but they have not found any
clues or witnesses that could explain
what happened
some people have suggested that this
incident may be linked to the urban
legend of
te
te tick tick a ghost of a woman who was
cut in half by a train and now haunts
the station areas she moves by dragging
her upper body with her hands and making
a Ticky Ticky sound and cuts anyone who
sees her in half with a scye or a sickle
however the police have not confirmed
this rumor and are still searching for
the truth they have asked the public to
state
I don't know if you guys have been
following distractable but my light is
haunted and it has been it has been
haunted for quite some
time I've tried to fix it and there's
nothing I can do about it so we're just
going to live with it however the police
have not confirmed this rumor and are
still searching for the truth they have
asked the public to stay calm and alert
and to report any suspicious activity or
information to
them is a syban legend res terrified all
right it's probably nothing this is
unbelievable how could this happen I

think I saw the convenience tour over
this way what is it with Japanese games
horror games and convenience stores I
always found convenience stores to be
comforting and
relaxing and slightly murderous but
that's part of the charm that's the
reason why you go
the thrill of it otherwise life would be
very boring this don't seem like
Japan given the American signage or
English signage anyway maybe some Latin
based
language Okie doie

She goes, ""Oh, my God. 'Bon Appetit' magazine.
Oh, my --
I'm going to be in 'Bon Appetit' magazine?
Oh, my God. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Maybe my shrimp recipe?"" I go, ""Whatever.""
I go, ""Think about it.
Call me tomorrow and let me know.""
And she said, ""Okay.""
So I get the phone call the next day and she goes,
""I got the recipe that I'm going to give.
It's my cheesecake recipe.""
I go, ""Okay, great, I love it. Well, can you send it over?""
She's like, ""Yeah, Daddy's going to type it,
because you know, he knows how to use the computer.""
So my Dad, ""I'll type the thing.""
So he types out the thing, makes a big deal.
-That's a really funny impersonation of your dad.
-He loves it. He loves it. -[ Groans ]
Cruel. Cruel.
-So he emails it to me, and so I get the thing,
and so I give it to 'Bon Appetit' magazine,
emailed to them.
They go, ""Alright, Jimmy, thank you.
Thank your mom so much.""
You know, we have to make this recipe
to make sure it's good.
Sure. Of course.
Do whatever you guys got to do.
So they call back the next day and they go,
""We made your mom's recipe and it's fantastic.
It's really good."" [ Crowd awws ]
I go, ""Okay, cool, I love it.""
""Can you ask her, is there a story behind it?
You know, did she get it from Grandma or somebody?""
Is there something behind this?""
I go, ""Absolutely.""
So I call my mom. She goes, ""Hello?""
I go, ""Bon Appetit' loves it.""
She's like, ""Oh, my God.
I'm going to be in 'Bon Appetit.'""
I go, ""They want to know, is there a story behind it?""
Is it Grandma's?
What's the story behind the recipe?""
She goes, ""Hold on a second.""
And she puts the phone on the chair
and I can hear her scuffling over to the thing,
and I hear she opens up the cupboard,
and then I hear paper, like --
And she goes, ""Yeah.
I got it from 'Bon Appetit' magazine.""
[ Cheers and applause ]

-Great story. -""I'm hanging up.""
""I'm hanging up the phone. I've had enough."""
Beast Reacts,"31,000,000","5,379,812,860",239,People & Blogs,2016,"- Have you ever wondered how paper is made?
- No.
- Goldfish, the foods you eat?
- Okay, yeah.
- Perfect, 'cause we're gonna answer all that in this video.
How water bottles are made.
- That doesn't it look like a water bottle?
- Oh, all right.
You just squeeze it with metal and then it inflates.
They all probably come like that,
so that way they can have different shapes
for different bottles.
And they inflate it to the bottle they want.
So that way you can buy a ton of them,
and make different bottles in the factories.
- Oh, really, that actually does make sense.
- And that is all just speculation from me,
that could be totally false, but who cares?
This is our channel.
- How to make ice cream sandwiches.
- Do you like ice cream sandwiches?
- Literally who doesn't?
- The ice cream could be better,
if they used higher quality ice cream in the middle,
it'd be better.
- Just buy high quality ice cream sandwiches,
stop buying the 50 cent ones.
- I go to Walmart, okay?
They don't got high quality ice cream sandwiches,
it's great value or nothing.
- Yo, someone make a high quality version
of ice cream sandwiches.
- Who's one of the big ice cream companies?
- Do you think I just search
ice cream companies in my free time?
- Bro, you don't be searching into ice cream lure bro?
- No.
- How to make the Lego mini figures.
Oh this how you get make the Lego guys
that get stuck in your nose when you're little.
Just me?
I got one of those heads stuck in my nose,
and I had to go to the doctor to get it taken out.
I really hope Tucker isn't like me,
'cause I was just very problematic
for a child. - Weirdo.
How instant ramen are made.
This ramen factory runs 24 hours a day.
Oh, is that spicy ramen?
- Ooh, I love the spicy ramen.
- Bro, imagine just grabbing that,
and just being able to eat off that conveyor belt.
- Just hot off the press.
Have you ever eat ramen uncooked?
- No.
- You haven't ever just sprinkled the stuff on it,
and then just eat it?
- No. - Okay, I guess...
All right, I grew up poor, okay?
- I didn't even know that was possible.
- You just sprinkle the season and on it
and then you eat it.
- It probably tastes like brick dust.
- It's kind of crunchy but it's not that bad.
- How to build a yacht.
Jeffrey Bezos and Elon Musk if you're watching,
here you go.
This is for the one billionaire that watches our videos.
The rest of you that aren't that one billionaire,
don't worry about it.
Even if I had $20,000,000 to spend on a boat
I don't think I would.
- This is why I got a Hundo.
- Nah, yachts aren't as much as you think.
- Jeffrey Bezos spent 500 million on it.
- Yeah, Jeffrey Bezos also owns the world.
He owns a couple of like oil tycoon.
- Oh, a couple of oil tycoon.
Yeah, you're right,
that's probably like a 15 million boat.
Now we're gonna react to how play buttons are made.
- You would know you have 30 of them.
- Actually we have 35 now.
- YouTube pays this company to do this.
- Bro, YouTube makes billions upon billions
of dollars a day,
do you think they care to make this?
- Yeah that's true.
- Do you think they care about a couple of grand?
How to move a spaceship.
- This is over the course of multiple hours.
- I thought you were about to say multiple days,
I was like bro, it's been dark the whole time.
- Oh well look at that, now it's a course of a day
because now it's completely daytime.
Even though I didn't say that, I was still right.
Why didn't they just build it there?
- Because there's a difference between
a manufacturing plant and a launched pad?
- What a bunch of idiots,
why didn't they just build it there
so they didn't have to move it?
- Yo honestly, don't you want a new iPhone?
Just build it in your house.
- Look at it, it's like, ""Ah.""
Hey, that's going to space.
- It went to space.
- Good for it.
- All right, so this is how they make speed limit sign.
- Nice.
- Wait, have you ever seen a 69 speed limit sign?
- No, this is a guy who makes them and sells them,
I've seen him on TikTok before.
- Oh that's lame.
I wanna know how the government literally makes
millions upon millions of sign across America.
- Jimmy, when I worked IT,
I actually had to work on the computer that makes the sign
and it is actually just like this.
This guy just bought or has one, but that's so cool,
he can make them say whatever he wants Jimmy.
And they're like legit signs too.
- So I don't have to keep stealing them?
- Jimmy, don't say that, that's a felony,
I found that out the hard way.
- How Goldfish arm made.
- What the freak is that?
Oh that's cheese, oh my god, it's so much cheese.
- Oh wait, really?
- Yeah, I forgot Goldfish are just cheese bread.
- Oh my gosh.
Wait, those don't look like goldfish,
those look like gold catfish.
- They look like gold flats.
- They look like gold wide fish.
Wait, that's it?
You just take cheese, and cut it, and burn it.
- I need to know more, how deep does this hole go?
- We should start a goldfish plant,
they don't look how hard to make.
Let's just do Jimmy fish,
and it's just like Goldfish just slightly crispier.
- Yeah, let's do it.
- How pencils are made.
- Tell you what, there wasn't enough made
in middle school when I was a kid.
And you gotta ask the girl beside you to borrow her pencil,
and she's like, ""No,
I gave you a pencil last time and you didn't give back.""
It's like I'ma need a pencil.
- I think they just didn't like you,
I'm just gonna come out and say it.
- Jennifer, you know who you are,
I failed that test.
Not because of the pencil,
because I'm not very smart.
- How to make custom rug.
- Oh, I love these on TikTok.
- I'm gonna make a Mr. Beast burger rug.
- Oh, a Mr. Beast burger rug.
- Why don't we have it under our feet right now?
- It looks ugly right now, but the blue--
- It does look ugly.
- It doesn't.
- You're one of those people that
lie to make people feel good.
- No, I'm one of the people
that can see the diamond in the rough man.
Look how fluffy it looks.
It looks like big bird.
- You think that looks good?
- I don't think it looks good as a rug.
- See, unlike him--
- But it looks good to rub my face across.
- Unlike him I won't lie to you,
it looks ugly so far.
We'll keep going though.
- This is so much better,
but we have more to go.
- Oh, see now it looks better.
Oh wow, that's pretty cool.
And by the way, if you're watching this and hungry
go order our beast burger.
Just literally download our app,
or go on Uber Eats, Grubhub,
or on all your favorite delivery apps.
Order one right now, it takes amazing.
How to build a wooden rollercoaster.
And if any of these guys here mess up,
you will die.
- The first thing I'm noticing
is a surprising lack of power tools,
and a lot of really old hammers
that are barely held together.
I don't know about this one man,
are you trust in your life with that?
- Oh, 100s or 1000s of people probably did.
- I don't like wooden rollercoasters,
what's the point?
You get the crap beat out of you,
and they're so short,
and they don't even really go that high.
- Yeah, and on top of that,
this thing could light on fire so easily.
- And burn down instantly.
They're like ""Yay, we have concussions and neck trauma now.
Woo, wooden rollercoasters.""
- That happens on every rollercoaster.
- No.
- Time out.

And un-timeout. - Bew.
- How to make Oreos.
Okay, this has to be good.
- You start with poo poo.
- But wait, that's brown And Oreos are black.
- Well it's probably when you bake 'em they turn--
- Whoa, when you bake your poop it turns black?
- Probably.
- Here's what they should do,
they should just take this and just break it
'cause we just want the white stuff in the middle.
I think I speak for everyone.
Why don't they do an Oreo where
it's the white stuff is on the outside,
and then there's one little thin black cookie--
- In the middle?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that would be good.
- What if they came out with a new Oreo,
and it's called just the white stuff.
- Can I just buy white stuff cream?
- Yeah, it's not even packaged,
it's just squirted into a Ziploc bag.
- And they need to call it the white stuff.
- The white stuff.
- Yeah, see, no, those aren't good,
look at that.
The chocolate to the white ratio is so off.
- Not on this one though,
this one's thick. - Yeah, that one is fine.
But like all these other ones I don't like my Oreos
when there's not much white stuff in them.
- This whole conversation becomes irrelevant
when you say vanilla Oreos,
because vanilla Oreos are incredible.
- I still would rather eat a vanilla Oreo
without the top than with the top.
- We don't have to agree on everything.
- But we can agree it's better than chocolate.
- Yes, very good.
I'm glad we discussed this, we got to this conclusion.
- I wiped my butt with this hand this morning.
- I also wiped my butt with this hand.
- Perfect .
- Newmans, Newman O's.
This aren't Oreos.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Who the heck is Newman?
- Oreo's corporate office, y'all need to sue Newman,
yo, he put his name on the package, sue him.
Making of a stream room.
Is this gonna be Ninja's?
- This better not be Ninja.
- Wait, is it?
Wait, did I call it?
Oh my God, I called it.
Why does everyone think of Ninja's stream room
when they think of one.
- Other people have stream rooms.
- Welcome to Ninja dojo.
- To the Ninja dojo.
Why doesn't Carl have a cool stream room?
- Yeah, some company should make Karl a cool stream room.
- From basketball to hockey arena,
you pick up all the basketball court.
Love how they're just Lego blocks.
Wait, do they just lay down ice?
- Yeah, it's just like Lego blocks of ice.
I never knew that, that's so cool.
Then they also get the Zamboni out,
the Zamboni polishes it and merges them together.
And I like saying Zamboni.
- Zamboni.
- Zamboni.
- Zambonith.
How to move an entire tree.
Oh gosh.
- Whoa.
- Wait, wait, wait,
they make machines that can just eat trees?
- No, those are gonna scoop the dirt out,
and get all the roots for the tree and move it.
This is so cool.
- We live in a day and age where we can move trees.
How to make paper.
- Wait, this is wood.
- If you're a tree watching this video close your eyes.
- Right now. - Close your eyes.
I will say turtle when you can open them.
Now that all the trees are gone.
- You tumble wood and then it becomes
this sheet by the tumbling power obviously.
And then you spin it for a really long time,
and then it becomes these tubes.
Then these tubes like to rub up against each other,
and what is going on?
- No idea.
All right.
And boom
Changed color. - And boom, paper.
- And now it's paper.
- Giant paper, and this is what giants use
to print receipts at CVS.
- No, this is what giants to wipe their butt.
- It looks like receipt paper, not toilet paper.
- You're telling me that's not giant toilet paper?
- Okay. - Checkmate.
- Yeah, you got me there.
- Adidas making the best running shoes.
- Are they these?
Because these are pretty fun to run it.
- That looks like a sack that
back in biblical times they used to carry coins,
and they just put some foam around it.
Does it not?
- What did I do to get this kind of treatment man?
- You ain't even got shoes on.
- Yeah, no shoe gang.
- Get those concrete grippers outta here.
- I need an explanation.
- Your toes they be gripping concrete
'cause they look like fingers.
- I didn't know shoes were handmade.
- I figured robots did it,
I figured robots did everything.
- Yeah, I'm pretty confident everything I see in life now
is made by a robot.
- I just assumed that had already happened,
I don't know anymore.
- Yeah, all right, well that's interesting,
Nike shoes are made by people.
- Those are Adidas, you idiot.
- What's the difference?
Five years from now when we're negotiating a sponsorship,
they're gonna be like ""You said
there's no difference between us.""
- And you're like, to be fair they are both literally shoes.
- How it's made, smallest car.
- Hey, this is an actual ""How It's Made"" clip,
I used to watch this show at 2:00 a.m.
while I ate cheese out of the fridge.
- While you ate cheese outta the fridge?
You should have baked it, could of had Goldfish?
- You just take one piece of craft single
and fold it in half and then eat.
It tastes better if you fold in half.
- Agreed.
- A little car.
- Yeah, I bet that's really fuel efficient.
How to make McDonald's fries.
I'm gonna take notes for Beast Burger.
- The glossiest potatoes,
and then send them through a freaking cannon
into a wire screen.
- Shoot them through a cannon.
- It destroys them at a million miles per hour.
And then you drop 'em in oil and put salt all over 'em,
and now they're taking a bath,
they're all hanging out in a pool.
You send them on a conveyor belt,
and then they put 'em in packaging
and then they throw 'em in grease again.
- Got it, Beast Burger has churros now,
now I need to go call the Beast Burger team.
Thank you for watching.

brain now guys we we got to survive until then though 3,000 is a lot of money stick around you don't want to miss it it's going to be awesome all
right now I got enough money for this let's put this guy over here all right here we go what's he going to do what you oh yo he is levitating is he
blasting oh his cool down is 3 seconds oh but he blast like multiple guys at
the same time we've never seen that before that's cool guys this is a brand new unit wa that guy is so strong so it
it creates a blast in like a big space and anything in that space gets nuked I'm going to I'm going to upgrade this
guy this guy is awesome look at his damage and you can upgrade to 500 oh explosion radius too so then the Rockets
will do more damage yo this game is lit bro all the new units are so cool and
that's not even the coolest part guys cuz we're still going to save up for that $3,000 upgraded Titan man I think
this guy already is very strong and guys this is just like I think it's the Epic or the legendary out of the new the new
hatching it's so awesome yeah I just love the animation too I bet if you have a ton of them it probably glitch the game cuz it' be like a ton of explosions
yeah you're probably right it looks like fireworks yo I upgraded him now he does 800 damage if you upgrade him again he does 1,400 damage that's so much just
yeets them right away and we're reducing the cool down guys this guy is awesome look at that that's insane now we do
have a boss coming in dual claw toilet he might be able to set him to sleep which would be very bad news here we go
nice big blast oh he s him to sleep oh he woke up really fast W he woke up he woke up wake up let's go get him nice
let's go man this is lit all right this is super lit now I'm going to upgrade him one more time then I'm going to
start saving up for that $3,000 speaker man are you serious upgraded upgraded
Titan Cinema man not not speaker man upgraded Titan Cinema man I'm put him like right here it's going it's going to be absurd it is a cinema man guys it's
like if you watch an IMAX movie in the skibby verse guys that is that is a
cinema bro Adam could watch him for a lifetime let's go let's go now I need a th to get this guy upgraded this guy I
think might be one of my new favorite units you think so just the way he he levitates and that he blasts we've never
seen that where they can blast and like do a bunch of damage to a bunch of units oh nice that is awesome big blast that
is so awesome and he's going to one hit of these guys basically they're not even getting to your plunger man no this is
amazing this is wow I'm so glad we hatched these this is so awesome guys
thank you all for watching and stick around you guys are awesome for watching these videos by the way yeah you guys are incredible look he's going to eat all of these guys these these guys don't
stand a chance bro look at this look kaboy kaboy no it's so satisfying too oh
this guy might set him to sleep though can they even get past he might set him to sleep though oh oh but wait a minute
oh he wakes up so fast he likee him after a big glass I upgraded him again oh he's doing
crazy damage now he's doing stunts and stuff bro nice dude he's doing tricks and stuff Bro Look at that Bruh Bruh got
him dude got him I think I think now we can save up for this guy I I think now we can save
up for this guy honestly think so we are on hard mode guys this is not going to be easy to beat this guys this is nightmare mode bro it's nuts are you
serious we're on night bro we're going nuts right now nightmare mode is the most tricky one in the game we're going nuts right now bro nice easy
oh we got two guys in oh we got a boss uh-oh spaghettio don't uh should we give
up don't don't no no yeah you're right don't give up Adam we shouldn't do that that's a bad idea nice don't um these
guys have a lot of Health buddy wait a minute these guys have a lot of Health atam wait a minute hold on ah
s what do I do another rocket Blaster and upgrade it but what if he gets put
to sleep uhoh another plunger uhoh I hit him what is that guy does 80
damage sweet wait this is awful this is bad and he got put to
sleep we might have had the wrong game plan buddy we might have had the wrong game plan is this going to O us
is this going ofus at him yes no it's not are you serious we'll see how much
damage these do this is this is not looking good uh
this is not what we expected to happen guys this is this guy is not good guys we can buy another rocket and see if he
can o the first one how would he stop them are you insane blast
them blast them blast them take a little longer ouch that was a bad idea by me oh I Adam
oh I Adam maybe he can get this guy yeah guys we got to get 3,000 and see this unit bro are you serious oh dear are you
serious Adam oh dear dear dear I can't believe you done this to us Adam this is not looking good I think we got to
switch up our Squad bro we have to see what this looks like bro we can't unlock him and not use him bro are you kidding
me yeah that would be bad oh there a mutant toilet oh oh o this guy does do a lot of damage
now let's just see guys let's just take a gander at how much damage this is going to do and uh oh oh we're fine it
did 50 damage F oh we're fine bro oh we're fine bro we're totally good all right all right guys we're we're totally
good I I believe in this squad bro yeah we can upgrade him no I we need to save money I need 3,000 bro please Mr Boss
toilet don't o us we're good dude we're good don't o us here big boss toilet coming in that's a big flush going in
right now let's see how much damage this does ouch all right we're live we're live
we're staying alive we're staying alive can we can we stop this guy though we might need to upgrade if I
upgrade him we're just not going to get enough money to get this guy but I'll I'll just do it we need to survive y we
need to survive guys all about staying alive just staying alive can't take the L guys we got to do it take no L's bro
well we almost took one right there nice got we got him we got him we got him now see you later mutant toilet nice okay I
think it was just the boss level was just really difficult I think we can do this dude yep wave 10 that was no joke
at all okay these guys are very strong they have a lot of Health probably upgrade this guy does more damage cool
okay start skipping waves and just going crazy honestly awesome love it cuz we
need 3,000 we really need 3,000 oh no uh wait a minute it's okay we we got
a bunch more backup over here uh hold up that's a lot of bosses hey Adam don't
cry stop crying okay I'm just getting a little bit nervous nervous that's all just a little bit Adam always gets so
nervous yep oh got put oh wake up buddy
come on no no no this guy can definitely catch him they're all getting set to sleep though it's bad very bad oh please
very bad oh please oh please oh please it's okay we just need to survive right now we just need to stay alive right now
bro I might upgrade this guy too if we oh they all get put to sleep so many
times uh that's a lot of bosses stop don't but I see one boss right here and
it's Justin foxy also foxy Justin never takes L's
guys this is looking a little bit sus just a little it's looking a little
bit sus guys we got a vacuum toilet with 46,000 Health making its way through it's making its way downtown it's
flushing fast oh boy I this might be an l oh boy
this might be an L we might have to switch up our Squad blast them all don't go to sleep don't go to sleep blast them blast them blast them blast them blast
them blast them blast them blast them blast blast blast BL BL BL BL BL BL BL
BL BL that's a l bro I can I can get another one okay okay it's worth a shot I get this guy yeah get it YOLO YOLO
upgraded oh he's doing absolutely nothing oh come on he's doing absolutely nothing a yikes oh oh he got through oh
no oh no guys we're playing on we're playing on nightmare mode it's not going to be
easy bro it's not going to be easy bro no one ever said it would be easy that is such an L honestly bro that is a huge
L is that it let's see our base that's an l l oh wait we're still alive vacuum
toilet though he's going to vacuum us don't vacuum the potty ever guys ever don't
ever okay guys we have a new Squad I'm going to use the science caman this is one of our favorite units this is one
that gives you money I think this is our problem last time is that we did not have these units very true guys we need those scientists working so now every
round we're going to get $50 extra dollar per scientist okay I have $ Z right now we have some skibbies coming in I'm going to use the engineer Cam man
that makes the little uh toilet cars I'll show you guys in a second what I mean I'm just going to wait guys our goal right now I think last time we
messed up by getting a bunch units we need to save up 3,000 as fast as we possibly can I love that as fast as we possibly can now I get the engineer put
him right there and the engineer is actually going to spawn little little camera cars coming out of our base oh
camera Rover now guys the camera rovers are really good because for only $200 it's going to clean up all these little units it's going to run into them and
just eat them all check this out guys it's going to be awesome that's a great unit to have I'm using my big brain to see if we can actually beat this and
save up 3,000 so you guys can see it's literally going to drive in there and just take them out oh wait that's great
it's pretty good pretty that's amazing pretty good let me skip a wave now I'm saving up I need $300 I'm going to get a
plunger cameraman I think this guy is going to help take out a lot of the B bosses and help just clean up a lot of the stuff early on in the game cuz that
that's what o us last time nice we those early level bosses let's check it out put them like right here it's going to
be awesome all right now will the little cars be able to take out all this yeah hopefully yeah I think so all right now
me let me get this cool get this and put him like right here all right now this guy's a huge huge range he's very slow
though but he has a huge amount of damage so he's going to attack one un to make sure they o oh all right we got it
it's okay we got a lot of little mini cars here take them out yep look look the car is so good nice Rover nice look
at that I could upgrade that that guy too the the guy who makes the Rovers oh cuz then the cars get more powerful the
cars get way more powerful but it's doing really good that might be worth it I don't know let's see I do want to
upgrade this guy cuz he's really good okay we got a boss coming in we got these but we got little cars I think
we're okay for now I love it the cars are doing good look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that dude I absolutely love it guys this is
lit okay now can we stop this guy that's the real question I think so I'm going to do strongest so he goes for the Dual
claw toilet oh nice yeah definitely that's a lot of damage sweet I might want to upgrade the engineer we got a
lot of little skibbies coming in 200 okay I'll upgrade them once so now we have upgraded toilet cars W how
much health do they have now right this one has 500 but the next one coming out we have 1,000 oh that's great yeah
that'll be super awesome let's go it's like a little Tesla that just runs over the toilets exactly look look we got now we got to toilet small camera toilet
cool yeah toilet this going to be awesome I'm going to keep upgrading this guy now guys we got to get to a place where we feel pretty safe and we don't
have all these units down here and then um we'll be looking good okay uhoh okay
there we go nice I got upgrade this and we're going to start saving up for 3,000 we're already going to get The Godly
tier unit I think so oh oh yep look at that take out take them out look at that look at that sweet let me upgrade this
now let me get more of these scientists I didn't max out my scientists awesome man get even more money guys that's the
goal that's great and this these little rovers are still doing really really really good yeah we really haven't taken
much damage guys this is perfect don't jinx it Adam don't jinx it wave 10 is coming up that is a Boss Wave so we got to be careful Big Boss Wave we're doing
good though he's doing really good go first he's this guy's doing really good I think if I upgrade him one more time
with a th000 I'll feel very very very strong yeah his radius will get so big should upgrade this guy 400 I think
that's worth yeah it's going to get 4,000 more Health yeah it wait that's definitely worth all right let's do it now the toilet is coming out we're going
to have 5,000 Health which is huge that's massive guys that's a that's a Tonka toilet is what that is that's a
great unit that's a Tonka toilet it really does clean them up
yeah let's see that Tonka toilet bro 5,000 look at that Tonka toilet
let's go man all right now we do have a boss coming in uh-oh I need set the guy strongest okay you can do it uh uh-oh
yeah he's got to get that yep look this guy put the S is to sleep that's huge perfect nice nice nice okay nice feeling
good get him out of here and we got the Tonka toy look just yeting them this is a way better round we're definitely
going to get to that Godly unit why don't say things like that Adam likes to say that and Jinx stuff why do you do that buddy well we got that Boss Wave
coming in in two waves I think we got it okay got take out the Dual claw toilet
but we do have the Rari the problem is the Rari the camera Rari sometimes misses the bosses like they can jump
over it wait are you serious yes they can jump nice okay the flying units jump
over it oh I see got it okay I upgraded this guy now I'm going to save up I think it's time maybe maybe I'll take a
Max Level I I want to be safe I I don't want to O again max level 1500 now we're looking
good this guy does so much damage he does 4,000 damage to each person yeah cuz then his cool down will go down I'm going to Max this guy out then I'll
start saving up yes smart wow look at Rari it's all the way up here yeah that's great nice skip wave nice we're
doing great guys we're doing really good but never get too confident guys you never know you never know when a toilet's going to come out of nowhere
and skib BM BM flush on you would you ever upgrade your engineer again I mean
that guy is really good yeah it adds 5,000 more Health should we do it for 600 I think so those are really really
good all oh you could double his health again to 10,000 to 20,000 is that one of the best units in the game it's really
good I mean look at these things they're just going now we do need this guy cuz he does so much single Target damage but
look there they're setting these guys sleep that guys we we have a way better setup this time like way better it's lit it's super lit certified lit guys yeah
guys look at oh he's asleep though nice look at the Rari just ran over him and also I think it's good cuz um do the
little baby Rover units get put to sleep ever I don't know I don't think so but there are units that fly and they fly
over these oh okay that would be bad that's very dangerous that would be terrible then it's up to this guy to stop him basically one guy I'm going to
upgrade all these guys so we get even more money guys we have to play smart but we're also trying to save up 3 ,000 as fast as we possibly
can we got it skip wave we're so close upgrade this guy again nice okay we're
doing good look at these things man I kind of do want to upgrade him a th000 is expensive though and I need 1500 for
this guy which one you going to upgrade uh probably this guy he does so much damage good idea probably this guy these
just take out the little units I need them to take out the bosses these cannot take out boss this guy the mune toilet runs over these little guys oh yeah he
skips them that's bad so this guy has to take them out himself basically he has to O him guys basically yeah which is
kind of scary otherwise we are toast why is he not attacking him oh there he goes come on take him out take him out come
on come on come on come on come on come on one more one more oh wait first take him up yes okay nice nice okay nice now
we're now we're doing good all right all right now I got this guy to Max oh another upgrade 4,000 no I know I it's
time for the max level guy honestly at that point the Titan
yeah that's going to be very EX guys yeah man we get so excited when we
think about Titans especially Cinema Titans I want to upgrade this one okay now we have uh oh you can do it
again 50,000 Health what is oh watch out this guy we got defensive wall here got
them now I don't even know what these look like these these guys have 20,000 Health coming in that's crazy it's a
really really good unit it's pretty good but you have to be careful cuz bosses run over them oh Ally damage per second
that's good too I don't know what that even means I have zero idea maybe it does damage to other people that's cool
I I don't think so H 4,000 upgrade that's that's too expensive I can't do that now look at oh yeah but it does get
yeed it just gets one hit yeed come on take these guys out this guy's very no okay this guy should be able to run him
over should be able to I don't know please got it all right guys we're at 1,800 after this round I think we got
this all we need is 3,000 to put down this brand new unit now you guys guys saw us hatch this in this video this is
not an easy hatch normally you're going to have to hatch a bunch of times we were able to get it and we're going to learn exactly what it's ATT attack it it
is super rare okay watch out for the vacuum toilet super duper rare oh the vacuum toilet just yeated our little
Rari okay nice yeah these are really good for cleaning up these small units nice skip wave I think uh let's be safe
I don't want to lose right now okay nice got them nice okay guys we're really
close to getting this I might be able to get this this round you can do it where should I put it here here or like here I think where you
had the first time I think it covers more track yeah here that covers but once I upgrade his range it'll like
waste a lot of his range H maybe right there yeah boom we just
got The Godly unit yo he's microwaving that's insane guys that is so powerful
okay the first upgrade is 3,000 that is really expensive we got to get it though we have to go max level on this guy yeah
yeah guys definitely now now look at this our raris are all the way over here look at that oh he's getting them now
this flies over our raris that's scary that's very scary so the rocket guy needs to blast guy it first we have to
oh nice we got him went away immediately may maybe he doesn't fly over them I don't I thought he did maybe they patch
that in the game oh that's nice so this guy is really just on microwave Duty get him get him get him get him get him get
him microw him like some hot pockets you guys Hear That Sound by the way we'll put the sound
in that's epic that is Godly
guys now is glasses uh toilet immune to our new guy our new Titan yes they are
so that's the only thing we have to watch out for guys when the toilets have glasses on I'm upgrading I'm upgrading yep upgrade no now he's got a purple
circle what is that he probably uses his blade and does even more damage in the circle this is nuts looks like a donut
oh yeah foxy say someone say donut hey fo foxy you want some donuts yes we'll get them right after this video dude our
team is too strong it's not even getting to them look at that look at that this is nuts this is awesome I'm feeling
quite good I'm going to save up 4,000 oh look at the microwave look at the the microwave does so much damage
woo and we haven't even seen the small range attack yet I bet he's going to yeah slice him oh there we go he slices
mini dab oh he can get set to sleep though that's kind of scary we put all of those guys to sleep yeah oh here
comes this guy wake up man wake up nice look at this microwave effect going on this is crazy I'm upgrade him again
perfect let's see let's see the the oh he's not even going to make it I want to see this the the the the the the blade
attack these vacuum toilets don't stand a chance a blade Attack yo got him
that's a lot of damage oh it's like a double attack he probably does a lot of damage with his blade yeah it slices him
and also does the TV attack oh it did like 10,000 damage that's great guys
this new unit is a amazing let's go he's got like cool like spikes like hair or something people were saying this is the
best unit in the entire game it definitely is look at that wow guys this is the best unit it's in a
class of its own it's literally go The Godly unit it's in a class of its own if we just upgrade this I think it's just
going to be amazing yes sir we're going to go Max Level oh he's going to get set to sleep oh no oh no we
got our defensive wall here he dodged it really good I really think though that the the the guy that spawns these raris
is like really good I think he's awesome Yep very true now we do have some strong
units making it kind of far I'm not going to lie we're not out of the woods yet a little bit sus that's okay okay
nice I kind of honestly 6,000 I kind of want to upgrade the little little raris
but I I'll wait until I upgrade them one more time okay nice it just deletes these little guys yeah but these are
weak it's all about the bosses oh so this can attack them even when they have glasses on that's kind of
cool oh I guess cuz he's got a speaker too oh that's that's why he's making
that that's why it's so powerful let's upgr him again now his circle is even bigger yo he's microwaving out before
they even come out we just got to keep going we got a boss coming in these are very very very strong does that do
damage oh it does okay I want to upgrade this guy let's see let's see the max level Rari honestly we've never even
seen that all right we're doing great here we go skip wave nice ye perfect
easy dude look at the microwave all right I'm going upgrade this guy this guy's max level we get rari's with
50,000 Health coming out of our city are you serious 50,000 Health that's insane
wow okay now let's see our team right now melt them I mean the melting is crazy the melty melty is nuts look at
that this is my favorite unit I think we've ever used yo wow 50,000 electromag magnetic
parasite disabling tank that's like in the Skiby we'll put a picture not a video a picture when they have the tank
in the in the videos oh watch out though these are very strong that's amazing guys we are going to disable all
parasites yes let's go those that's how they infect the skibbies GH they infect the skibbies yeah little hackers yeah
dude this guy is Godly he's really strong they're not even coming out of the base anymore you're right I wonder
if I can get another one dude if you do that you're nuts but you can should I
take this guy to max level let's go Max with them first and then get another one okay good idea airplane toy now this flies over araris I know that for sure
look at that see that oh so that's the only one we need to watch out for that guy's dangerous yeah nice so we're going to upgrade this
guy to max level guys then we might get that dual Titan it's like his brother look we got multiple parasite tanks
coming in these guys stand no chance no parasites Allowed no zero mhm let's go
easy Dude Sweet we're doing good guys we got to make make it the weave 50 so let's not celebrate too early let's go upgrade yo you can upgrade him again
look at that rain oh he's got a laser wow long range attack so now he
does the microwave a laser and the blade that's why this guy is Godly he's got
three attacks look at that that's incredible hey yo so guys we're already
on Wave 28 we're over halfway there I'm turning on auto skip let's go dude let's go I'm I'm a crazy guy you sure I'm a
crazy man no Auto skip no these have lasers too all right we're doing good these
have lasers too we're doing good look look watch this oh it does damage look at the car no look at the car wow the
car has lasers too it has damage and health we have double laser attacks
going on right now oh we can blast them from all the way over there we got double laser attacks going on right now that's lit and he's microwaving this guy
is busted oh he does the job of like three Titans in one okay that airplane's
getting by oh no we're good the airplane is SK is sketchy because it can get over these parasite uh tanks mhm parasite
tanks they blasting from there oh they're just posted up
chilling okay nice we're almost at 10,000 I think that's max level for this guy yep that has to be come on let's
go Autos skip is getting a little bit sus I'm going to turn it off just in case come on so close there we go oh he
can keep going 15,000 are you crazy bigger radius bigger
damage it's lit I don't know if we should do that
though why too dangerous it's too dangerous it's too much it's too much time without new unit I think we should
get another one okay okay just upgrade them yeah mhm this say better Titans
better damage lanky
box right guys right guys that's true that's true
guys this guy right here Justin sometimes when he's eating pizza he'll call himself Papa Justin what no I don't
sometimes and also I don't know nice guys I put him here now we got now we
got two Godly Brothers like us what yeah we're
brothers yeah we're brothers but we're not as powerful as these guys yeah I would be the not
upgraded one yeah you'd be this one I be this one yeah very true with a laser Blaster yeah buddy yep but don't worry
Adam you you'll power up here see I'll power you up there you go buddy thanks man I really needed this there you go buddy awesome nice now I got a blade
like you BL yeah guys this squad is so lit we're on Wave 34 I'm feeling pretty good honestly I do want to see what
15,000 gets you but I don't know if that's worth it let's go with 15,000 I can upgrade this guy a Max Level I could
upgrade him already but I'm just going to save up let's let's try to get to 15,000 I'll upgrade him if I have to okay smart there's a lot of strong units
though I'm I'm still kind of scared it's still a little bit scary I believe in you thanks buddy I know you could do it
that's like me dude look at my muscles exactly guys Justin is super strong and he can lift a lot of weight he's got a
jetpack just like you yes in real life I um I put a bottle of Coca-Cola on my
back I put a Mentos in it don't try do not try that but I blast it off I actually touched the moon right guys uh
he did that at the same time that I double bounced him on the trampoline and he actually went to Mars I went to the moon yep I went to Mars insane slingshot
it around to the Moon using gravitational pole why do you laugh at me why do you
laugh at My Dreams no I remember that day it was crazy it was crazy now guys we're on Wave 37 can we get to wave 50
stop laughing you're such a not cool
brother you are not a cool brother"
Mark Rober,"28,300,000","4,424,206,159",130,Science & Technology,2011,"- This is the world's first ever actual pool of Jello.
(upbeat music)
And while it may look simple,
it's actually a very difficult engineering challenge
to pull off.
As proof, if you google Jello pool,
you'll either find bad CGI
or a handful of videos of people who tried to do this,
but it really didn't work out.
So today, we're gonna answer possibly
the longest standing question from my childhood.
What would it be like
to actually belly flop in a pool of Jello?
But before we do that, I want to talk
about what we actually had (tape screeches)
to go through for the past six months to pull this off.
The idea of a Jello pool has been
on my bucket list (mellow music)
for over four years.
In fact, when Kevin from the Backyard Scientist
and I made the 25 million Orbeez pool,
our first idea was to do a pool of Jello.
But it's really hard because if you've ever made Jello,
you might recall, you first have to boil water,
then mix in the powder, and then you have to refrigerate it
for it to actually get firm.
And that's easy enough to do for a small dish,
but how do you boil and then refrigerate an entire pool?
This seemed like a very worthy engineering challenge.
So last year at Thanksgiving,
my brother and I came up with a plan,
and then in the middle of winter,
we started digging a hole in his backyard.
Then over the course of two months,
we set up a bunch of small-scale experiments
because we needed to answer questions like:
How much gelatin powder does it actually take
to get to the ideal firmness?
And how hot
and then cold, does the mixture actually need to get
for the Jello chemical reaction to take place
so it will actually get firm?
And from our experiments we learned
the Jello always got firm as long
as the mixture got hotter than 160 degrees Fahrenheit.
So we decided we could scale this up
by using six 55 gallon drums
with a custom propane burner underneath
and a spigot we welded to the sides, but more on that later.
So now we knew how we were going to heat it up,
but how do you refrigerate an entire pool?
For that, we teamed up with Mother Nature
and just picked the perfect location and time of year.
We installed a thermometer and starting in January,
we tracked the temperature
in his backyard every night. (chalk scratching)
We needed refrigerator temperatures
at night (bell dings)
but not freezer temperatures, (computer buzzes)
because that would freeze the Jello,
and our experiments showed that totally ruins it.
And so after looking at our data
plus historical temperature plots,
we knew we had about a three week sweet spot window
towards the end of April to pull this off.
Our goal was to have a Jello pool party
in his backyard that would make
even Phineas and Ferb jealous. (kids laughing)
So the plan was to start seven days
before the party (mellow music)
and fill the pool with an average of 10 barrels every day.
That would give each layer a chance to get exposed
to the cold night air
to more efficiently get rid of the heat.
And so with that, the first thing Saturday,
a full week before the party,
we got to work. (water splashing)
(upbeat music)
We didn't want to waste actual food,
so this is just water and gelatin powder
and food coloring, but there's no sugar.
We intentionally placed our barrels much higher
than the pool so when we were ready,
we could use the potential energy to move the Jello
from the barrels to the pool.
(Jello sloshing)
We had to tackle about a thousand other issues
that came up that I won't bore you with,
but day by day and layer by layer,
the pool began to fill up.
Because the Jello went in
with so much heat energy we needed to remove
before it could get firm
in addition to using the cold night air,
my brother's neighbor Nick happened to have
a spare swamp cooler in his shop,
so we kept that running over the top
of the pool pretty much the whole week.
This gave us convection cooling.
It's the equivalent of rolling down a car window
for the pool or like when you blow
on the top of a hot cup of soup.
This constantly replaces the boundary layer
of air right at the surface with fresh cold air
that will suck out the heat more efficiently.
And so, as we put in the final batch Friday night
with ominous weather threatening
to ruin the whole effort (upbeat music)
at this point we had done all we could.
We were exhausted after a week,
and I wasn't feeling super confident,
because my specialty is more (machinery whirring)
with mechanical things,
and this project was more about chemistry
and thermodynamics.
And I didn't want that lame Gelli Baff stuff people try
and pass off as Jello.
And so even if it didn't last long in the sun,
I wanted to at least have the experience
of seeing even a single belly flop
on a smooth pool of actual Jello.
If this was gonna be a total failure,
it wouldn't be from lack of effort.
And so we woke up Saturday morning
with a forecast for a warm sunny day,
and we pulled off the tarp
to find a pool filled with actual freaking Jello.
(pensive mellow music)
And by this point,
word in the neighborhood had definitely spread around
as to what we were up to,
and my brother asked if some
of their friends' kids could have first dibs.
And so with that, I'm happy to report,
this is what it looks like to belly flop
in a pool of Jello.
Not yet. - [Parent] Wait, wait Adam.
- I'm okay!
- [Parent] Careful! (laughs)

- When I first got in myself,
it was closer to the middle of the day,
and one of the things we discovered
was that direct sunlight over time had the effect
of undoing some of the solidness of the lower layers.
(Mark laughing)
When you go in, it just, like,
fills your nose and, like, ears.
It's a very surreal feeling of just being, like,
it's kind of hard to move,
but it's just slimy and slippery.
It actually feels really cool.
We have some pool toys (upbeat music)
hidden underneath.
(laughs) Got it!
Wow!
It's unlike anything.
I mean, it's like swimming in snot
(laughs) if that makes any sense.
But like a good snot. (upbeat music)
To keep it solid for even longer,
if we were to do it again,
we might put in a heat exchanger pipe system
beneath the surface,
sort of like how they freeze indoor ice skating rinks
and maybe use a little sugar.
That's disgusting!
Now at this point, you might be thinking,
why would anyone spend the effort of six months
of planning and then a solid week
of backbreaking effort just to make a stupid pool of Jello?
And to that I say,
""Why do people go (inspiring music)
through the effort of climbing Mount Everest?
Why did Neil Armstrong go through the effort
of stepping on the moon?
And why did Pam and Jim go through the effort
of convincing Dwight that Jim had always been Asian?""
- This is Jim!
- Sometimes you don't do a thing because you should,
but simply to prove that you can.
Now that my curiosity was fully satiated
and in my ongoing quest (upbeat music)
to be the favorite uncle,
I told my nephews they can invite some
of their friends over,
and my brother's family set up a neighborhood barbecue.
And at this point, after a lot of hours of belly flops
and bowling balls and direct sunlight
the Jell-O was pretty broken down,
but that didn't stop us (upbeat music)
from setting up a Jell-O pool slip and slide.
(singing in foreign language)
- Here I go!
- And I love their sense of adventure,
but it was a bit of an uncle fail moment,
because apparently,
none of them have ever used a slip and slide.
(singing in foreign language)
(Mark laughs) (Mark's nephew yells)
? And everybody starts to move ?
? As soon as ""Pata Pata"" starts to play ?
? Whoo ?
? Whoo ?
? Whoo whoo whoo whoo ?
? Whoo ?
? Whoo whoo whoo whoo ?
(singing in foreign language)
We didn't actually put any sugar in here,
so it's kind of disgusting,
so we've got some real juice.

(tense music) (creature roaring)
(dinosaur squeaking)

today guys I'm gonna teach you how to
take a coin just like this place the
coin into your hand and then bake that
coin Oh disappeared and that's about it
so if you want to learn how to do that
just keep watching know what's going on
guys dad relative and welcome back to
the channel
now today guys I'm gonna be teaching you
the first magic trick I ever learned
it's the matching tree that I still do
to this day and it gets amazing
reactions reaction is just like this see
ya guys if you want to learn how to make
your friends and family react just like
that then grab yourself a coin and let's
get into today's trick so guys this
magic trick is super simple all you need
Tutorial
is literally any coin you're gonna place
the coin in your vaio left hand
depending on which hand moves you're
gonna place your thumb on the bottom of
the coin and your four fingers on the
top of the coin when you're in this
position guys the tricks really simple
all I'm doing essentially is
unpretending to grab the coin by my
other home but what I'm doing is
actually dropping it into my right hand
just like that so from the front guys it
looks like this when the coins really
still in that hand
so yeah that's essentially how the trick
works but let me get into some of their
details so guys when you're first
learning this trick make sure that what
you do is you hold the coin like this
and make sure you just get in the habit
of literally just putting the coin into
the other hand so then you know what the
natural Martian looks like so literally
just practice in front of a mirror
actually grabbing the coin so literally
just practice to action and make it look
as naturally as possible when you've got
the hang of literally just grabbing the
coin then you're ready to start learning
the trick so once again guys when you're
doing this you place your thumb under
the coin and you literally just drop the
coin and pretend to place it in this
time then you can magically make it
disappear once again guys from an over
angle you're going to pretend to grab
the coin from behind and then literally
drop the coin and pretend to grab it
make sure as well guys that when you
doing it your full hand covers the front
of the coin because you don't want to be
doing this if you do this then there's
not even a trick because you don't want
to get into a habit of doing this
because then obviously you've expose the
trick so guys when you do it make sure
you're covering the full coin with your
hand just like this
and then when you're in this Marsh and
drop the coin and then pretend to grab
it also guys you want to make sure this
move looks as natural as possible here's
the wrong way of doing this trick watch
the coin very carefully guys we're going
to take the coin just like this watch
watch I'm going to take the coin I'm
gonna make it disappear that's not how
you do it
the more natural you do it the more
powerful it's going to look so the way I
do it guys is I don't even draw too much
attention to the card
I literally just hold the coin do the
secret move that we've learned and then
I just drop this hand I don't even draw
attention to this hand give it a blur
the kind disappears and then by this
point I've already put the coin inside
of my pocket or I've just laid it down
on a table and sometimes guys when you
do this trick I like to make the card
reappear it's literally as simple as
this and guys something cool you can do
with this trick is once you've made the
coin disappear you can make it reappear
just like this literally just pull in
the coin forward and then making it
appear you can make it disappear and
then reappear behind people's ears which
is one of my favorite to do so yeah guys
the opportunities with this little trick
is absolutely endless it's only limited
by your imagination so one more time
guys just so you've got the hang of it
you've got a coin like this you pretend
to grabbing it you obviously drop in the
coin drop in this hand at the same time
making it disappear
that's another knot guys when you made
the kind disappear don't keep this hand
in display because sometimes I see
people do this so they'll grab the coin
and then just make it disappear then you
bow then straight away you draw
attention to this hand so what you want
to do is go like this and then drop this
hand straight away take this hand
completely out the picture and let me
show you one more time how I would
perform it for people watch this I'm
gonna take your kind just like this
watch it very carefully three two one
gone and that's how I do it as simple as
Outro
that
see you guys have fun we've learned in
the coin vanish as I said it's the first
magic trick I've ever learned and maybe
it's the first magic trick that you've
ever learned see ya guys make sure that
before you perform this trick I'll go
out to show it to people that you
practice practice practice and if you
guys post any videos of this trick make
sure you tag me in it my Instagram is

love to troll him in Minecraft so today
we're gonna be trolling my brother's
houses and not just any houses 10
amazing houses that he's actually
created on my minecraft server as you
could see down below my little brother
has no idea that I'm here right now he's
building his he's just building one of
his little dirt houses and I've got a
TNT cannon ready for him he has no I do
yet guys this is my first house I've
built and I know it doesn't look like
the greatest thing ever but trust me
it's gonna turn into something wait I
haven't seen Preston in a while
hope he's not up to something weird okay
guys here we go let's fire the cannon
let's go go go and just a little bit of
that and a little bit of this and
goodbye little brother sounds
literally blow up everything Preston why
do you always do this I wish I could
just play this game without getting
trolled by my older brother at least one
time I can't do anything to stop it I
knew he was up to something I just knew
it it's my very first house and I loved
it and now it's just gone it's just gone
just good all right now we're getting
down to business I'm not getting my
house bone up one more time this time
we're making it out of obsidian okay
guys so Joshua now is building his house
with obsidian and he thinks that somehow
I'm not gonna be able to destroy that we
all know you can't destroy obsidian with
TNT now he's built a slightly bigger
house he decided to put an obsidian roof
on it like that's gonna stop me so what
I've done is I've got a command to put
myself in vanish so he can't see me
bizarre look at that totally invisible
you can't even see me and I've got this
pickaxe called the super pickaxe look at
how fast I move and look at how fast I
can break things it's like instantaneous
oh yeah look at this guys look how fast
like a brake blocks I mean this is gonna
be so easy so now I've got to sneak in
through the underground break his out oh
all right so we're just gonna go add
mine through here it doesn't break wood
very fast but anything that is made out
of
you know like solid blockage and whatnot
it breaks incredibly fast all guys were
almost there we're almost there I think
we're just about to be on the other side
just a little bit more mine I feel like
we've been mining so much what is this
cosmic presence calm oh here we go here
we go yes yes look you can tell where I
blew up his previous house and there he
is fine I want to put my pickaxe away so
he can't see me look at this look at
this an idea should I punch him I feel
like that'd be really mean no I'm not
gonna punch him okay maybe a little bit
let me a little bit look yeah
it's no idea let's go guys let's break
everything you know what I feel like it
Oh Mike look at that obsidian look at
that obsidian oh this is beautiful he's
trying to hit me sorry Josh it's not
gonna work buddy I've got those super
big gags you can't touch me baby you oh
oh we actually touched me okay I'm
embarrassed let me just go on break
these two all matted and you know what
guys
look at Josh he's actually trying to
catch up to me sorry little brother it's
not gonna work and let me just go and go
up to my kid and real fast all right
sorry about that Josh where did see with
the TNT cannon twice in a row but oh my
gosh
he moved his house guys he's literally
trying to replace the Obsidian no no no
no no no no no where did you get all of
this obsidian have you been going to the
nether place you can't get up sitting
from the nether what am I talking about
sorry Josh I've got to blow up your tire
outs I can't let you put down any more
of obsidian this cannot happen you
cannot have a perfect house wait there's
still obsidian no I've gotta break it
wait oh my gosh
and I got the last piece of obsidian so
mad right now
alright guys so this is my new house and
I think I think this one's gonna do the
job I know Preston won't mess with this
house because half dieese has kind it's
his own kind also just just to have the
final touch and we have a little car
here and I'll give you a tour of the
house that you know it's pretty nice
upstairs and yeah
so if person breaks into this one I
don't even know what I'm gonna do
Third House
oh I feel so bad for Joshua but this is
gonna be the third way to troll your
little brother's house in Minecraft guys
so what I have right here are sheep
spawning so if you place down the sheep
spawn egg and then you type in this
command right here
bad things happen let me just show you
really fast yeah it spawns a TNT on the
rainbow sheep exploding it so I'm gonna
summon a ton of these rainbow sheep near
Joshua's new house and he's probably
gonna think the sheep are so cute if he
didn't know sheep is one of Joshua's
favorite animals so he's gonna go crazy
over them probably let him into his
house and all this stuff like that and
then I'm gonna execute that command and
his entire house is gonna blow up from
the inside out it's going to be
hilarious oh by the way smash the like
down below if you want to see me troll
my little brother and minecraft more
this has been way too much fun look at
Josh down there guys he has no idea
what's about to happen so what I've done
is I've placed two secret command blocks
one in the bottom floor of his house one
in the top floor of his house he thinks
I'm not gonna blow his house up because
it's made out of cacti and I do love
cacti but at the same time I love
drawing my brother a little bit more
than I love cacti so here's what we're
gonna do we're gonna type in two
commands and it's going to start
spawning in a ton of rainbow sheep watch
look at all the sheep that are spawning
in right now oh my goodness gracious
okay and then now I've got to spawn in
sheep in the other place give me just a
second so we just bond in a ton of sheep
in the upper area now we're spawning
sheep in in the lower area and now what
is that I need to probably kill those
chips that are spawning and look at all
the
look at all the shape guys okay I gotta
be sneaky sir Joshua can't see me what
do all those sheep better in there Josh
it's not me here
oh this sheep got stuck oh these sheep
got stuck okay
so Joshua if you didn't know love sheep
he has no idea right now that I'm about
to explode all of them
let's give Josue a little bit of more
sheep I feel like he can use boards
cheap let's bought in a ton of sheep you
know what I mean like Joshua loves sheep
he's gonna have his sheep but also you
can exhibit its command oh my gosh his
entire house just blew up yep look at
the tea oh you can even see the command
blocks
oh I goofed this one up I covered Oh oh
dear God
this might be my favorite way ever to
troll my little brother in Minecraft all
right what's up guys so this is my new
mansion I just built and there is no
possible way person will break this
Preston loves modern houses there's no
way he's going to break modern houses
and if Preston tries to do something
kind of fishy I have this diamond sword
to protect myself this is the fourth way
Fourth House
to troll your little brother's house in
Minecraft so right now - you guys I look
like my normal Preston plays skin right
well - Joshua I'm actually disguised as
a slime and he has no idea
Joshua loves slimes almost as much as he
loves sheep so I know he's gonna invite
me into his home and then the chaos will
ensue Oh
what's up there cute slime are you lost
come to my home all right guys here we
go here we go and this entire house has
turned into slime he has
okay now I'm gonna undisguised myself
guys this slime there we go oh my gosh
I'm on disguising oh it's killing me
he's killing me guys no no no no why are
you doing this judge I just wanted it
earlier you know what Josh you deserve
this I will just slash kill myself oh
yeah I don't deserve to be fun I just
sit through his house again guys this is
my fifth house that I just made and I'm
pretty sure this is the one I there's no
way to break this it's made out of
bedrock there's no way for Preston to
break this it can't use tnt on it
because if you play Minecraft you know
you cannot break bedrock with anything
Fifth House
so once again I am in vanish mode Joshua
has built his house out of exactly
really cute guys he's built it out of
bedrock any thinks that's gonna stop me
well this is number five in the ways to
troll your little brother's house so
well I'm gonna do the troll Joshua's
I've got this point right here selected
and then I'm gonna select this point
over here in the sky
by doing a fancy command just called
slash slash pause to which selects my
second position actually I need to move
a little bit more over here we go and
then we're gonna type in this command
slash slash cut and boom he has lost his
house and died early and what we're
gonna do because it's made out of
bedrock ground we're gonna just go ahead
and move his house over to the nether no
big deal you know just totally casual
moving my little brother's out to the
nether and you know let's go ahead and
just put it above lava I mean why not
let's just do a little bit of this
command slash slash paste and bazinga
his house is now engulfed in lava
literally until I actually feel really
really bad for him right now I don't
even know where he is I see him looking
in the nether he's lost he's gonna be in
her
where does he see his house he's going
the wrong way no Josh it's this way
there he goes he sees it he sees it all
I'll punch him towards the house
wait this way bro okay that's it I'm
gonna TP to him how I'm going to TP him
to his house because he doesn't even
know where he's going there we go
look at Charles jaws just encased and
engulfed in lava just jumped in the
lobbies going to die Josh it was being a
noob he might die he might actually I
can make sure of it I can make sure of
it there we go now he's definitely going
to die he's not fire he is no idea what
to do how is he not dead yet you need to
die brother what is going on here is a
tank he cannot be killed
he's the most handsome little brother
alive dad gummit Oh and now there's TNT
being spawned in this house okay I think
my little brother has been trolled
enough for today ladies and gentlemen oh
and also I've got whoa I think he just
died I've got one more command I want to
do to his house if you type in this
command it literally flings TNT at the
house how amazing is that so I've got a
lot more trolls up my sleeve guys if you

lunches by time traveling to every
decade to taste some of the best and
worst foods ever served in a school
cafeteria on top of that some of the
foods are now banned and illegal to
serve in school cafeterias starting with
the 1910 be 3 cents thank you in the
1910s a school lunch usually consisted
of corn on the cob potato soup bread and
some prunes now before we eat this feel
like we're missing
something the help
wow I love the fashion in the 1910s
you're going to love the food even more
let's dig in face
[Music]
Fest let that mouth do though actually
it's not bad you know this was also the
decade that women were allowed to vote
Yes Go Power I would rate this decade
two stars out of five all right let's
move on to the next
decade 19220 here I
come during this decade alcohol was
actually illegal but also an average
school meal cost 7 cents thank you
school lunches consisted of beef stew
rice pickles and milk now before we eat
this is also the decade where school
buses were first introduced let's dig
in oh finally some meat
o wait why did I hear some sucking sound
what was up with that
ooh oh stretch is good I can dip my
grilled cheese you know the 20s are
often referred to as the Roaring 20s
this is when women started wearing
dresses showing their shoulders knees
and ankles oh is that where the term
School thought came from cuz send me
back I want to see them
ankles and sniff them
Jack you know this is when milk was
first introduced in the cafeteria cuz
Milkman would deliver them fresh every
day M that milk is good do y'all have
any
more oh the milk man's actually right
there I think he's delivering some milk
to the bus here go go go go go go go get
him get him get more
milk Mr Milkman got any extra
milk wait where's the milk right
here I think I would Rak this mil a wait
do you hear that wait why is the bus
shaking
on yeah just
like yeah what are you okay yeah
what are we doing we're just trying some
milk yeah bub
milk uh let's just travel to the
[Music]
next in the 1930s a school lunch cost 10
cents this was a decade of the Great
Depression where families were living in
poverty and some even died of starvation
and you won't believe what people had to
eat at school
lunch uh what the hell is that we're in
a Great Depression question you're lucky
to even get this now 10
cents so a school lunch in a 1930s was a
raw onion stuffed with peanut butter
vegetable broth milk and some mixed
veggies before we actually eat our food
we have a special guest who went through
the Great Depression to tell us what
that was like and if the school lunch is
accurate or not yeah this is it this is
what we got it's pretty accurate all
right what should we eat first oh you
always got to eat the vegetable broth
first let's dig in doesn't look too good
but what choice we got I don't what is
that 3 2
1 what the hell is that it's water we
use the water to wash the vegetables and
then it turns into vegetable broth
pretty good
[Music]
huh back in the day this was a delicacy
you could only have it if you could
afford it in case you guys are wondering
or we wearing potato sacks and is that
actually what you guys wore back then oh
yeah everybody wore potato sacks they
would use the fabric from the potato
sacks I used to love my potato sack
shirt now on to my favorite dish stuffed
onion with peanut butter you guys would
actually eat that oh yeah I'm not going
to try it bro you try it please I'm only
doing this for you guys oh dude no am I
actually doing this okay 3 2
1
[Music]
how would you not eat this you ever been
so hungry you ate sleep for dinner when
we were hungry we slept kids nowadays
have it so
easy um let's hope the next decade is
better he wouldn't have lasted 5 Seconds
back in my day don't even know how to
eat a peanut butter onion properly
now we're in the 1940s where Coke was
first introduced in school lunches but
was quickly removed because during the
time Coke had actual Coke as one of the
ingredients in the 1940s school lunch
cost
[Music]
25 got some
cook wao
who knew I would make it this far they
hat they never believe me a school lunch
in the 1940s consisted of Spanish rice
and eggs homon grits and milk L wait
wait wait wait wait before we eat you
know a lot of kids were sent home during
this decade due to the funding drop from
World War II leaving a lot of kids
without food for lunch that honestly
really is sad but let's
in wo wo wo wo wo W sa something for us
man this is so much better than prison
food God I don't want to eat anymore
I mean if that doesn't tell you that
this food is good then I don't know what
will hell yeah you know what this
reminds me a lot of kids actually fought
over food during this decade because
this was their only meal of the day and
that's where the term give me your lunch
money actually comes from lunch money
matter of fact give me your lunch money
hey I don't have
any not on my school
campus give me one second just got to
get over
here
you knock that off right
now
oh I think I need to go to the nurse's
office in the 1950s a school lunch cost
[Music]
35
[Music]
an average school lunch would consist of
a sloppy joe Tomatoes milk and ice cream
so we're outside eating because this is
actually where the greasers ate I caught
a sloppy Joe I'm actually so excited to
eat this before you eat the tomato
what's one part of the vegetable you
can't
eat imagine if he finished the
joke all right let's actually dig in
now
[Music]
I like this you guys want to
bite you guys want to bite whose idea
was this I've never seen anyone just eat
tomatoes like this so an interesting
fact over 50% of the kids stayed for
school dinner as well due to the baby
boomer phase where the population
dramatically increased hence the term
Boomer hey thank you for the food yeah
tell me about it it's
[Music]
done I got
CH they're
multiplying oh how was the food
[Music]
electrifying next decade in the 1960s
school lunch was increased to 50 cents
because everyone's favorite food was
added to the menu
Pizza my lady and
[Music]
ladies the Aver school lunch at the time
consisted of pizza salad Jell-O and
apple juice I'm excited to eat this
pizza you guys want to split it half for
me and you guys split the other half
what if we just all take a bite that
seems more reasonable they had regular
pizza but like Square
[Music]
Pizza
[Music]
[Music]
happened scientifically it's just you
know what I'm I'm going to control
myself wait you actually don't believe
in a moonland wait do you actually not I
don't I really you don't believe in a
moonland I think it's fake I think it
would have costed more money to fake it
than to do it for real agree to disagree
but me landing on that ass was real
hey yo what do you think of the meal
overall well the jello was good the
pizza was good and ladies you can have a
pizza
[Music]
me in the 1970s schol lunch cost
[Music]
75 and it consisted of a hamburger fries
pudding and and
Coke this looks good this is the year
when school lunches became the most
unhealthy yeah this is probably Alex's
Favorite Year dang dude this pudding is
good I don't think pudding would be good
for you Alex please you shouldn't be
eating anymore yeah no I actually no hey
hey hey hey you could barely fit in that
outfit dude that pudding is so good
there's actually a hole right
here actually a butt did pop out all
right let's try to main course a cold
cheeseburger that was it I love it it's
good yeah it a little bit red inside
yeah it's a little too raw for me I
don't know if I trust this yeah what the
next decade's a little bit better than
this in the 1980s school lunch cost
$1 thank
[Applause]
you and they consisted of baked chicken
mashed potatoes brownies corn and apple
juice all right so 1980s was actually
year at the job
yeah I'm happy we time travel to this
timeline cuz give me the
chps hey
y yeah oh yeah CH oh wo w
w a few moments later why don't you try
the balls later and try some meat how's
that pretty good yeah I'm going to try
the chicken that is one big chicken
nugget hey I know this is unhealthy cuz
this is really good I will say this I
know this tastes good but federal budget
cut reduced school lunches by $1 billion
which is why in the 1980s they had
highly processed food probably is going
to give us upset
stomachs wait my stomach hurt
uh-uh I don't know if I want to finish
this meal after that did you guys hear
that let's just go on to the next
decade in the 1990s school lunch cost
$125 but that's when the welfare program
came out so I ain't
paying an average school lunch would
consist of McDonald's Pizza Hut or Taco
Bell along with a side dish and lemonade
this is what I eat every day no that's
way too much food Tanner nah not enough
dig in oh M I feel like this was
definitely everyone's favorite school
lunches but let's see why everyone got
obese unhealthiest what are you talking
about this wasn't served every single
day I think it was only served on
Fridays damn it we should probably stop
eating and go to the next decade for we
all get through that I think it's too
late for
that in the 2000s school lunch now
skyrocketed to
$1.75 let me get that
[Music]
number for .75 you would get mini corn
corn dogs hash browns a pair chocolate
milk and fruit rollup ooh this is the OG
fruit rollup I remember this from first
grade and corn dogs I used to trade the
little wieners for other people's
cornbread cuz I didn't like the I didn't
like the wieners yes but I like the
cornbread it was always Sean who wanted
the
wiener started from a young age man
starting to make sense now corn bar
going back to it like it was definitely
weird for someone to accept a
Wier oh my gosh I feel like I'm 6 years
old again I know it's pretty good and as
you guys can see the Mills were slightly
getting healthier due to the alarming
rates of obesity in the '90s glad I
didn't grow up in that time era cuz you
would be even fatter I will see a lot of
kids playing frute rollup chicken I
actually want to play to try it out
you're going to face alen okay and
you're going to stick the fruit roll up
in your mouth and you guys are going to
keep eating it and a first person of
chicken out loses
go yeah let me join in the fun let me
join let me
join
keep going you're not even close save
some room for me
guys I'm done I quit I quit that was way
too
close but ladies I wouldn't chicken out
with you let's move on to the next
decade in 2010 which is actually both of
our years school lunch was around
$22.50 for us and the average meal
consisted of spaghetti and meatballs a
bread roll green beans and fat free milk
and you guys might be wondering why
we're in the school restroom and it's
cuz we've eaten lunch quite a few times
in here yeah we'd eat in a big handicap
stall it was the most awkward thing
grabbing your lunch trying to find
somewhere to sit when there was nowhere
to sit so we would actually eat in the
restroom yeah but all right let's try
the food I'll try the bread
bro yeah this is we the spaghetti and
meatballs might look good but they taste
way too healthy yes the 2010s had the
worst tasting food because of how
healthy they try to make it just like
back then I'm hungry so I'm just going
to
eat
[Music]
someone what
the is someone taking a
W wo wo wo
[Music]
you jump into the next decade before
that happens to
us
for this decade school lunch is
skyrocketed up to $5 but usually
consisted of a healthy meat wrap mac and
cheese carrots bananas and apple juice
and before we eat this meal we actually
have a very special guest here a
subscriber would you say the school
lunch is accurate is this something
you've eaten at school before this is
pretty accurate but I feel like there's
a lot more options that could be put on
this plate and how much is a school
lunch now $5 oh wo W wo you could buy a
100 meals from the 1920s buy a lotion
with
$5 what do you want to try first what
what's your favorite thish year banana
banana my
banana do kids make fun of you at school
if you eat a banana of a guy eats banana
or do you have to chop it up and eat it
with a fork some people are weird about
it all right well let's dig
in I like this I wish this was around
when I went to school we just had cold
pizza now that we were done with our
meal we had one giant surprise for our
subscriber all right so in our last
video we mentioned that we will be
giving away a special surprise to a
subscriber you can open your
[Music]
eyes you're joking right this is
yours it's yours actually
[Music]
yes thank
you"
FaZe Rug,"24,800,000","8,068,905,827","2,226",Gaming,2012,"hey Noah what are you playing bro get
out of my face dude are you okay I'm
actually in the middle of something so
if you can just like leave me alone it's
a blank screen hello bro get broing my
gaming experience I don't I just don't
is this a GS5 what is this it just came
out it's a slim hold on I'm so confused
right now bro your old age is really
getting okay okay yo I bought a bunch of
knockoff teu products just to see how
they compare to the real items wait Noah
is that Madden bro I'm trying to tell
you you weren't looking at the right
screen or something I'm trying to play
like get out of my you could play Madden
on the GS5 dang the quality is so good
bro can you please stop yapping on the
sidelines all right so we got the GS5
versus the PS5 let's go through some
comparisons here right I don't even know
what to expect with this this is the
console itself I think it actually comes
with games wait there's no way there's
actual games on there honestly the
controller looks pretty identical look
at that just a big weight difference oh
yeah this is very very light like
obviously the build quality on this is
just way better like the small one right
yeah yeah of course like like it's
actually really cheap paper we got the
GS5 for a whopping $30 dude that is a
steal so you just noticed that there is
a Micro SD card in the back so I'm
assuming that this is where all the
games are on it make the most sense and
everyone knows a regular PS5 is $500
let's see if you get the bank for your
buck on 30 bucks all right we got it
plugged in let's see if it makes the
same
noise nothing the PlayStation's only
iconic when it makes that noise
has a red light which is not a good sign
do you guys remember the red rings of
death for an Xbox 360 that was the worst
let's see what happens oh yo game
station 4K wait actually looks Cris
there is
1,500 pages of games that's nuts let's
go Street Fighter 1 wo it looks good oh
hold up I'm cooking right now just
kidding I'm getting cooked all right I
got knocked out I got knocked out wait
it's actually like good quality and you
get real games for $30 that's not bad
NBA what what the hey yo bro hit a shot
simple hey for a teu product I think
it's pretty fire next up we got mchip
boots bro we got the ones from Teemu and
we got the legit ones right here clearly
you could tell which one is fake bro the
weight on these is so freaking light
this is heavy bro okay this is bad hold
on hold on okay dude I'm going to put
the real one on two just to see the
difference I mean from the looks you can
already tell but oh my dude it's it's
actually stuck okay okay putting on the
Tey ones you're not going to have a
problem with exactly look how easy it is
to take off easy I like this way more
these were actually $28 and the Mischief
boots are $300 that's insane that's a
major difference but I think I'm feeling
chaotic I want to cut into both of them
just to see the material on the inside
you're going to ruin your actual boots
to be honest I'm never going to wear
these again this is our first time using
this thing it's a foam cutter and it's
super super hot let me start with the
teu one
here oh it's like that oh oh my gosh
it's a slow process but you have to wait
on it oh it's going oh come on bro you
broke the foam cutter bro dude hey I
just saved you money honestly we can't
see what's inside this but let's crack
this one open okay be honest with me bro
what were you expecting hold up we're
about to turn this into Yeezy slides oh
no we lit bro hold on hold on okay well
obviously I think we know which one
takes the K I think it's this one yeah I
was going to say just this piece yeah we
have a $20 teu Rolex versus Noah give up
the real Rolex why do you think it's me
I just know it come on hand it over a
$10,000 Plain Jane Rolex I don't really
mind if jewelry is fake or not yeah I
mean a watch is a watch I feel like it
doesn't matter as long as it looks good
like a blue face rolly come on that
looks good from afar I think to put this
to the test we should go out in public
and just ask what people would prefer to
wear without knowing what the price of
them is you want to resize it before we
do this or are you chilling no no this
is like how you're supposed to wear stop
you hear the clanking all right all
right I got my rly on the wrist no look
at this bro he don't even need to size
it do you think other people are going
to choose this though bro stop put your
tongue away bro which watch do you
prefer blue face or plain Jane I like a
little color I would say the blue face
bro blue face okay okay Bet excuse me
guys can we ask which watch you guys
prefer a touch a color in there
appreciate it thank you which watch
would you guys prefer to wear slash a
color yeah yeah this one so the color
all right you pick the color as well I
would say this one I like same same what
about you this one all right it just
shows you don't got to spend your whole
bank account at the store pull up with
one of these bad boys you're good to go
price really doesn't matter with things
like this which watch would you guys
prefer to wear yes sir blue face right
blue face it's nicer all right I think
we got a clear winner here we got Mr
oversized blue face baby versus the real
Rolex crazy we have a staple here for
the OG vloggers out there the Canon g7x
goated I have made did so many videos
with this very camera they're so
reliable too wow dude it's like G7 X's
make you look so much better than you do
in real life like the quality is so good
actually yo what's going on guys it's
your boy FaZe rug dude it's personal too
it's like up close dude come on that's
why I love this camera but Noah what do
you got there I got the boki it has a
nice lens it's a macro lens at 52 mm 56
megapixels is that good for this it's
pretty good oh I'm excited to see the
quality bro ooh hold up Bokey wait hold
on what I actually want to see the
quality on that this is insane is it 4K
it's 4K 30 frames per second but I don't
believe that like there's no way wait
how do I zoom
in look at this comment down below if
Brian switched over to this camera and
everything was filmed like kind of like
this y'all would still support right
it's not horrible it just reminds me of
like when my mom used to record Home
Videos back then he a Canon g7x roughly
around
$630 this I want to play a little game
with you do you think this camera is
higher than 50 bucks or lower than 50
bucks I already knew where this is going
Underdog yep there's no need to fear
because Underdog is here guys the
greatest place to play fantasy sports
and it is available in over 30 US states
all you do is pick higher or lower on
your favorite player stats and you could
win up to 20 times your money let's go
all right Noah so what do you think is
it higher than 50 bucks or lower it's
not the best of the best but I'm just
going to say this it has 4K quality the
build's not terrible you can put a
tripod under it saying higher and just
like that you would have got that pick
right because it is $70 wow dude good
stuff with Underdog it's been making
watching sports so much more fun here
are all the picks that I've gotten right
ever since I started using Underdog and
it just adds so much thrill to watching
sports there's a special pick them going
on right now the goat LeBron James at5
points all he has to do is score one
point and you get that pick right what
do not miss out on that one brother sign
up on Underdog fantasy.com by clicking
the link in the description or you can
go to the app store or you could scan
this QR code and if you use promo code
rug Underdog will double your first
deposit up to
$100 come on SO coming from someone with
a lot of camera experience do you think
the Teemu version is worth it yeah I
mean if you have an extra 70 or so bucks
laying around you really want to get
into cameras but you don't want to make
that huge jump into getting a really
professional expensive one I mean this
will get you by I've seen a ton of
airpod like Brands these ones from teu
are $8 what versus
$190 real airpods bro $8 okay I'm going
to put them back in here so I can
connect them to my phone usually my
experience with knockoff airpods is
there's just no base it's a case by case
situation right here but look at the
bottom of this USBC you got those three
little dots I really don't know what
they're for and you have this like
little side piece that I think you can
like connect something to your keychain
whereas this you also get that USBC at
the bottom not too far off other than
the magnetic charging usually real
airpods will do that airpod Pro let me
connect mine nothing is even popping up
Noah how do those feel great in the ear
especially it feels like it's hugging it
I can barely hear you right now all
right let's test these out hello hold on
this is not bad I'm playing golden live
right
now
it's actually not bad that's so weird
the only thing about this video is that
we can't test how long they'll last for
cuz you never know like this could break
tomorrow but there's a lot of base on
this meanwhile I'm getting popups right
here use your iPhone to scan your ear
geometry for improve spatial audio okay
that's crazy I didn't know airpod Pros
actually do that what okay of course if
you're paying $200 for real airpods it's
going to come with that technology but
if you're just there to listen to music
nothing Advanced I think these are
actually pretty good for $8 bucks that's
not bad at all the audio coming out of
these I mean I don't even have to
explain it it's amazing there's no need
to go for it $7 Yeezy slides okay what
and these are
$175 for the real ones get a good
comparison here real quick bro honestly
these are very light if you felt them
you'd be able to tell that obviously
they're cheaper material yeah heavier
for sure on these if you guys have never
tried Yeezy slides it feels like you're
walking on a cloud dude it's the best
feeling ever see the thickness comp
comparison okay you could clearly see
that this one's way thicker and it has
like different ridges you know what I
mean like mine goes up a little bit on
here yours is kind of just like flat
flat hold on let's see them on the feet
dude they serve their like purpose
honestly bro if I saw this I would not
know then again I'm not like a crazy
sneaker head dude these are so comfy I
think this is another good one where we
go to the mall and ask sneaker heads
which ones they think are real or fake I
think they're going to nail it I got $7
Yeezy slides on my feet Noah's got 150
let's see who's going to win this one
which shoes do you think are real the
Yeezy
slides okay okay okay bet we're not
going to let anyone pick them up or feel
them I think it just has to be like a on
feet type thing yeah especially here a
real thing okay what about you those
ones are real dang is this one easy to
the sneaker head man to the sneaker
heads yeah probably we're going to
another shoe store we're both wearing
black
ezy he just tried snagging something
real Qui keep him in check I have to
keep him in check and we wanted to ask
you which one you think is real or fake
and you can't touch oh I can't touch you
looking like that that's fake right you
sure Final Answer yeah I'm going to say
final answer all right you got it right
you got it right this one's actually
easy to tell all right bro doing that at
the mall gave me an idea I want to play
real or fake with you okay so I'm going
to bring out three items and you're
going to choose which one you think is
real and fake easy but whatever you
think is real you keep that item okay
it's a win-win right I think so no it's
not whatever you think is fake You Must
Destroy and then I'll reveal the answers
sounds good you ready yeah let's go all
right first up we have two juice World
vone shirts okay scope them out nice I
like it the butterflies I've never seen
this one before but I feel like I have
seen a jersey version of vone I think I
just think this one has to be real I'm
putting this one fake this one's real
you get to keep that and now You Must
Destroy This there you go like I don't
want to celebrate doing this cuz I mean
it is a shirt it still can be used but
it's okay oh my God you just don't know
if that's the real one brother brother
that hurts for me to see there's a
chance this could still be real I'm
confident though she just got to keep it
going wait I feel so bad yeah this was
the fake one oh okay okay well you get
to keep the real shirt and you just
destroyed the $6 shirt yes okay okay all
right we got the off-white Air Force One
Lowe's check them out these ones are
really identical I'm not going to lie
these are really nice great quality so
are these I mean that's don't turn them
that's interesting definitely one has a
little bit more wear and tear one looks
a little newer I could have done that to
trick you okay cuz I haven't seen you in
these a million times off the bat these
are real boom these are fake they look
too brand new some minor things on here
look a little off now You Must Destroy
these happily the shoes that you think
are fake are now under the 6,000 lb car
tire please do the honors he's that
confident oh oh bro oh my oh something
popped hopefully it's not my
tire yo oh wait that's not oh wait dude
look at this look at this yeah they're
definitely gone you were right yes let's
go these are yours I'm not going to take
them off you bro they're your shoes yeah
but we're the same size they would fit
great but I just don't want to take your
shoes W man's bro appreciate you got you
bro all right you ready for the last one
bring them on Louis Vuitton purses bro
this one's a tricky one oh I know my
purses get a good look at
them that's important bro hold on this
one's a little flimsier like usually
usually when you have these type of bags
are firm like I feel like this one's a
little bit more firm in the hand you
can't really like fend it that much this
one I can like the straps look pretty
good just not as good as these I mean
this looks like shiny gold whereas this
one looks like copper I mean what is
that bro it's an upside down LV logo
okay time to destroy this one please
bring it on should we just go for it low
key that's making it better oh oh oh oh
you messed it up here I got you okay
little do you know though this is the
real one you're lying I'm not I hated
doing it bro well I mean we're already
halfway there let's just finish it off
right but also I'm kidding that's the
fake wa really yeah yeah come on bro you
got that one wait it looks so cool I
might have to just keep this one instead
speakers you got to love them I do when
you shower when you play sports any
circumstance so here we have the TNG
versus the iconic JBL the t-u version is
$17 and the JBL is $90 I got to go you
know about my appointment it's the
appointment the appointment okay are you
being serious
bro oh you're back already yeah a quick
appointment okay yeah yeah should we
test them yeah let's test them you
already know the one song we can only
play on this channel without getting
copyright don't say it's the going live
sadly it's it's going live I hate that
song all right we're going to start with
the JBL sound test
okay I do I just know it though I love
when the speaker does
that I don't know if this makes sense
crispy it sounds really good bro and
that's what you'll get with the $90 of
course but now let's see what the TNG
sounds like herur me up oops sorry wait
you could change the song from this good
for 17 bucks I have yet to find a
speaker that you can actually change the
song from the speaker you can't do it
with the $90 one usually that's volume
but let's try let's go back to the $90
real
quick that's volume you can't all right
so I just saw one benefit with this I
mean every time I'm in the the shower
and I want to change the song like I
have to reach out and go to my phone but
this is through the speaker for the
cheaper one too that's actually dope now
let's hear the
quality okay you could definitely hear a
quality difference as you can see no
Bas I agree with you you could hear a
quality difference this one's obviously
a little bit lesser quality but is it
$73 difference I don't think so I think
I'd still be satisfied with this in the
shower like obviously this one is better
but if I'm spending almost $100 I'll go
with this one for less than 20 bucks
there's barely a quality difference I'm
honestly happy with both I have to take
this call real quick wait yo hello why
is Noah so busy all of a sudden but
anyways as I was saying I personally
would be happy with both obviously if
you want to pay less for something this
is
still you finished the phone call oh
yeah it was a fast one are you going to
stay here for the rest of the video well
yeah I just had to do a few things it's
okay people have things to do you know
what I'm saying appointment really
changed you bro no the appointment was
was crazy yeah I think the speaker was
sick I
agree I forgot we were filming I think
we're in the mall again oh it's like
click this right here this pillow ranges
from $300 to $500 and this solid $1
19.99 you want to know something crazy
this is so much more softer than this
bro it's uncomparable it's bigger look
so the colors on this one is a little
like sharper but these are more colorful
if I knew about this before I have a
bunch of these real pillows I genuinely
would have swapped them with these all
right now what you grab the cheaper one
I'll grab the more expensive why can't
we swap for ones bro like always giving
me the downside oh okay here come I'm
honestly down I'm down all right we're
going to see if more people actually
think this is the expensive one or that
what do you think of this pillow makes
me happy looking at it one of these is
$300 to $500 and one of them is $19 this
is a $19 did I get it right you got it
wrong I got it wrong it's crazy this is
actually the cheaper one and it feels
better look softer nicer than this one
this one's more rough
which one is more expensive this one
this one okay what do you think uh I
said the one left it's wrong this is
this is actually the more expensive one
c
c oh which one of these do you guys
think is more expensive this is you guys
are right everyone else has said this
one what made you guys think that's more
expensive we need a tiebreaker right now
one more person Solo solo now which
one which one of these is more expensive
that one this one's the more expensive
one that's incorrect this one's the more
expensive one wait what made you think
this one though that one had like was
like more rough yeah right that's what I
was saying it's like more rough let's
head back to the crib all right we got a
$40 switch from teu AKA Swap and then we
have a
$350 it's real right cuz it kind of
looks off this is kind of cool look what
I noticed on the back it's like what is
this it's two hands hey attention to
detail is kind of something I've noticed
it's a pattern look how thick these are
and hard to press these buttons are
actually really thick all right let's
turn this one on let's see what $40 can
get you for a switch what is that it's a
c c oh this is like the GS5 it has a
Micro SD card last one had so many games
it's glowing the buttons I didn't even
notice that either hey like you said
attention to detail wo Aladin
Castlevania Crash Bandicoot wait they
actually have a lot Tony Haw wao that's
crazy yes oh oh yo hold on you got to
test this out
WWE
this actually is fire bro has so many
Gams I would actually buy this $40 dude
that's kind of a steal worth it for sure
that was by far the coolest item that we
tested today so guys let me know in the
comment section down below which item
you guys were hyped about the most this
was so much fun I love doing review

contrasting bro and really just seeing

James Charles,"23,900,000","4,220,411,976",539,Entertainment,2015,"one week ago I uploaded a video to my youtube channel titled Tati this video was a direct response to the video that
Tati Westberg uploaded to her channel titled by a sister before I say anything at all in this video I want to make it
very very clear that everything I said in that video in regards to it my sentiments towards Tati and my apology I
stand behind 100% and still rain true I know I got emotional in the video I
apologize it was something very very hard for him to deal with especially when it came to talking about my very own mother in talk to his video she
discusses many of the different reasons as to why she was choosing to close a chapter in her life that I was heavily involved in making many of our private
issues very very very public and now millions and millions of people have weighed in with their opinions and
speculations on subjects that they honestly know absolutely nothing about I will not ask for sympathy and I will
definitely not ask for forgiveness either but I will ask that you watch this entire thing all the way through before forming any further opinions or
talking about this story more hello future James here popping in quickly I know doing an insert in a video like
Future James
this is not professional trust me but I filmed this several times now and as time keeps going on more and more things
keep coming out into the public and more people are speaking on the situation and it is very important to me that this video has all the information all the
facts all the receipts and is current and present because I will not be addressing it again after this matter
this morning when I was editing this video I noticed that last night totsied uploaded a video to her channel called
why I did it and this morning Geoffrey Starr was on snapchat talking about the whole situation first and foremost I do
want to issue a thank you to both Jeffrey and Tati for taking some of the responsibility for blowing this whole
thing up and for starting everything I really respect that a lot and I also appreciate the fact that they are trying
to redirect the hate away because I think we're all aware at this point that it has gotten way too far the past week
on the Internet has been at the darkest I think we've all ever seen and it's also been the darkest time that I've
ever had to go through and my life and my thoughts gone to a really scary place
watching takis video it's clear to me that she also is in a really dark place as well and has been pained by this
whole situation if I've known anything about talk to you over the past three years it says she has a huge huge heart
there's no tonight and I think that or I do believe her when she says that she did not want this to get so vile I don't really think any
of us thought it's gonna be as big as it really was in both of their videos Jeffrey and Tati both mentioned that they hope that I'm able to change and
then we can all move on from the situation and trust me I agree there's nobody that wants it's over with as much
as I do but in takis second video and in Jeffrey snapshots they both said that they stand behind everything that they mentioned
and unfortunately there have been allegations made against me because of these things and I don't really feel
comfortable just moving on from those I would like to take this video today as an opportunity to kind of explain
everything that has happened and address literally everything there's a lot that happened behind the scenes leading off
to talk days video and there's a lot that happened behind the scenes and publicly after takis video and I feel so
it is my responsibility to kind of let you guys in on those because there's a lot of misinformation going around and
it's just not really good just like talking said in her video this whole situation is a lot bigger in the despite
immense and I think anybody who's kind of followed the situation is well aware of that at this point trust me I am too
there are way bigger issues here that I will be discussing and talking openly and honestly about later on in this video I have a few notes in front of me
here and I want to make sure that I hit every single point and that I don't miss anything but that being said to get to
those issues this did start with vitamins it was kind of the catalyst so I want to make sure we kind of go in order and you guys are able to get the
full context and full story of everything if that has happened starting off my friends and I all tend to Coachella weekend one from April 11th
through 15th and I had an artist pass provided to me by a brand we had a really really good weekend I mean you
guys saw the snapshots Instagram pictures and outfits and my video it was really really fun and we will definitely never forget it but at Coachella I had
drama with a boy that I had been talking with for five months prior and it all kind of clouded at the overall memories
later on at that very same week on April 19th my best friends and I in the family group chat made the last-minute decision
that we wanted to attend Coachella weekend to again to kind of relive those memories but boy free I texted my
manager Jake that very same night asking it to be possible to get us in for the next day since it was already Friday we
nee were missing the first day of the festival so therefore we could only go on Saturday because it was so at last
second we were only able to get VIP tickets which is not the same as artists but we had it over anyway and wanted to
have a really really good time for those of you who may not be familiar with Coachella I do want to quickly clarify the different passes just because it
kind of is important to this whole situation if the IP although VIP is still very very open to the public
artists passes however our passes that you can not buy the only way you can get a hold of them is through a brand
getting them from the actual festival or through having a personal connection to one of the artists or bands that are
playing it's in a very very highly secured area that is not open to the public a lot of artist passes though
there's also something called a performer pass and backstage passes and a lot of other things that can keep you more protected keep in mind weekend one
I did have an artist past weekend - I had a VIP going into the situation when
we walked into weekend 2 with me my friends on a Saturday April 20th and Sunday April 21st we notice that there
was a major major difference and at the crowd we were in the VIP section and I started getting mobbed really really
quickly at a super unsafe capacity because as many of you guys know when I've always stopped to take a photo kind of other people tend to come and it just
turns into a big situation and it honestly it was not safe I had remembered from weekend one that my
friend Nikita driving home is with a lot of the time was brought by sugar bear hair and had an artist pass personal
security and backstage passes and was very very taken care of and safe what I felt unsafe in the situation I panicked
and I text Nikita and asked her if she had a connection to the sugar bear hair team that could potentially help me out
Nikita replied right away and she gave the sugar bear hair team at my personal phone number to which they reached out
to me and offered to come rescue me with a pass and backstage access and security to make sure that I was okay and was
able to enjoy the festival along with my friends you went to Coachella somehow had a security issue and magically sugar
Coachella
bear hair is there with a contract in hand to save the day for you and all of your friends no company would ever go
out of their way to have an extra you know handful of passes that cost thousands of dollars apiece
like just in case that leads me to believe that this was orchestrated beforehand but he had an emotional
conflict because of me and promises he made me behind the scenes so he had to come
up with a very clever story and didn't tell me right when he got back but after the little bit was posted on their
launch day despite we talked you said in her video of this whole situation was definitely not a big scheme that was
orchestrated beforehand it really did happen on the spot the sugar bear hair team texted me their proposal right away
no money was involved and with no time to negotiate in a panic I signed and that was out on that James Charles he
had nine days after Coachella to talk to me on Monday April 22nd which was one
day after Coachella I was due to post my stories based on my contract and up until that moment I honestly had not
thought about the fact that talk to you was a sugar bear hair a competitor and in that moment I thought that as a friend she deserved a courtesy text to
let her know the context on the sponsorship and everything that was going on to not even get a phone call to
not even get a text a few days prior but right after that sponsored post went up
to have a text like hey mom love you I'm stressed just so you know XYZ I just did
this post but it's no big before posting my stories I actually did text 20 first out of respect for her giving her heads
up about the sponsorship but she was immediately upset I try my best to kind of explain the entire situation and also
gave her a direct apology as well but at this point I had signed the contract and I absolutely had to post it there was no
getting out of it I then headed to the airport and took off on a flight to San Francisco by the time that I had landed a one hour
later talk to you - uploaded all of her Instagram stories of her crying talking about the friends the community that haven't really supported her how she was
alone and how she felt very very hurt and betrayed very quickly people put two and two together and realized that this
was clearly about me and I started getting thousands and thousands of tweets and comments and texts about the
whole situation throughout the next several hours I made countless attempts at text both Tati and her husband James
and many phone calls as well trying to reach them all of which they did not respond to and later on that night while
sitting in my hotel in San Francisco because I could not reach talk to you I assured a public apology directly on my
Instagram because I really wanted to make sure she saw that I was sorry and I wanted to end the situation by taking full responsibility
for my actions over the next several days I made countless attempts to contact both Tati and her husband James
on all their different phone numbers I texted and called a Tottie's business number her family number and also
James's personal phone number as well after a full entire week of trying to reach out and handle things in private
with Tati on her husband James and getting no response I figured at this time it'd be best to just respect their space give them their privacy and that
whenever talked to is ready she was reached back out to me to handle things in private and hopefully move on with our friendship that is everything in
regards to the Instagram stories that we've talked about that I want to discuss a few of the things and talk to this video that were misleading and
false the reason that James always said that he couldn't promote halo on his channel and really do like you know
heavy endorsement was because he has a teenage audience and it would just be inappropriate now this thing was just
confusing to me mostly because this conversation never actually happened if you guys know my channel you know that I
don't really do dedicated product reviews ever which is what Tati is known for but even though that is the case I
have still multiple times that talked about her products are almost social media networks I have to worry okay I
forgot to say - hello I'm going to a really important event later on tonight my best friend we are going to yes this
is true and this is a very important loss to me because it is my best friend - mopti it she's launching something new on HeLa beauty I'm super proud of her by
the tennis videos oh it'll already be up so go check it out probably for talk to you love me the most who doesn't need a little beauty boost every now and then - the following
statements are real claims made by your original halo beauty booster so oh can I
just say I love you guys for putting a Halo question in there
as I just receive a package from a halo beauty this is Todd he's a brand-new brand mom I did not tell talk to you
that I was buying these going to pay for these myself because I just wanted to support her and I'm so happy because I
know she's worked so hard on these for the past several years now congratulations auntie I love you a
little you so much I do want to keep this video strictly based on facts and
receipts but one of the most hurtful things taki did and her video it was bring up my mom and questions her
parenting no tears this time my mom is the strongest woman I have ever met she
is kind she is creative and she is caring she is a cancer survivor and she balances a marriage a full-time job and
raising two boys absolutely crazy lives she's taught me so much in the past and
when I made a mistake she has never turned to public humiliation as a form of punishment all
that being said I love my mom and I think she's doing a damn good job if I do say so myself
the last phone conversation that James Charles and I had he said some things telling me about a situation that
happened in Seattle at my birthday and it literally made me want to vomit oh my god you tried to trick a straight man
into thinking he's gay yet again and somehow you're the victim you know it's
really disgusting to manipulate someone's sexuality especially when they
are still you know emerging into adulthood and don't quite have everything figured out you are using
your fame your power your money to play with people's emotions and you're doing that to have them behave sexually in
your favor even if they're straight and you know what that's not okay and how dare you laugh about it and make me
master meme and retweet and this and that and I love straight boys I love straight boys and make it a joke because
this behavior is not normal it's not okay cracking someone's sexuality is not an
escape room first of all I am a 19 year old virgin I talk about boys quite a lot
My Story
of my social media networks clearly at this point and it's not acceptable anymore we're talking about that a little bit I promise you but just thought I would
bring it up put it out into the universe I don't really get a lot of action we have probably guessed this at this so that being said I have never and
would never and will never use my fame money or power to manipulate or get any
sexual actions from a guy that is disgusting it is not me and the fact
that Tati brought this up blows my mind because she knows the real story the
story that were talking about here is a situation that happened when I was in Seattle for talking surprise party with a boy named Sam now I'm going to tell
you the full story since everybody seems to be leaving out literally every single detail in talk to each video she
mentioned that she was disgusted and had to apologize to her family for me apparently saying things that I wanted
to do to a waiter and then just to find those actions by saying I have a celebrity okay this literally did not
happen what did happen is that me Jeffrey Nate - my best friend drew all flew to Seattle to surprise talk to you
for her birthday on February 14th that night we went out to dinner with that with Tontine James and her whole family
and we're in a restaurant there was a cute boy across the restaurant that I kept making eye contact with and that I
was interested in and the conversation of dating for me and Jeffrey both came up the dinner table and we were talking
about it for a very very short period of time the conversation never got inappropriate period the boy that was
involved in the story is named Sam now when I originally wanted to do this video addressing everything I did plan on crossing his name and keeping him
completely private but he has since come out and made a video of his oh not talking about the situation just like
talk to you leading out many many details but in his video and in the screenshots that I have Sam mentioned
that he was perfectly fine and found the flirting that I was doing flattering so I'm not really sure why this got turned
into something much bigger but it simply was not he was looking at me later on that night he started asking me if I had
a Valentine this is this was on Valentine's Day where he especially thought that I was very attractive and
he wanted to get my phone and all that but the waitstaff at my restaurant didn't let that happen
he left and it kind of just went and talked about the Imus Liberty thing is
really incredibly frustrating to me because this is an inside joke between my friends and I had that Tati is also
participated in and she twisted this to be something far worse than what it is this is the joke that really is where we
say I'm famous not I'm a celebrity and it's thing that we don't say it in public very often because without
context I get it it looks and sounds really really bad trust me literally
famous is synonymous of anything good so yeah my YouTube video does well one day my friends was like oh my god James are
so famous but literally if my friend takes a good Instagram photo oh my god you're so famous if our boneless buffalo
wings that Chili's are extra delicious one day oh my god these wings are so so famous it has nothing to do at all with
fame power or money which is what Tati eluded it to being and it is so frustrating that she turned an innocent
and funny inside joke that she has participated in into something so beyond disgusting I'm going to try my best to
make it a long story very short the next day Sampson into my DMS first and I
happened to see it we started talking back and forth and he mentioned that he was flattered by me flirting with him at the night before head sorry about last
night you're very attractive and then I was very flattering actually a few
minutes into the conversation I asked about his sexuality and he told me straight up that he was bisexual oh my
god you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay there was no straight man at being manipulated
anywhere in this story like Tati mentioned later on in the conversation he asked when I was leaving Seattle and
I told him the next morning to which he responded I wish we had time to hang out and I said hey why do you come over to my hotel tonight we can watch a movie
together he said sounds good later on he messaged me first and told me hey straight up
I've never done anything with a guy before I'm a little bit nervous too which I told him there was absolutely no
pressure this is all shown in the screenshots Sam showed up at the hotel we watched movies together and we
cuddled after the movie I asked him if he wanted to kiss to which he said yes I get to the hotel room we say hi it's all
fine we had watching a movie and after that movie he asked to kiss me I said yes and we ended up making out for
around an hour and if I'm being honest he's the worst kisser I've ever kissed
way too much time all right note taken um after making out Sam for
over an hour I did invite him to sleep over at the hotel and he kept telling you to stay like please say please say
don't leave me all this knob and I really wanted to go home so I left of course I want to spend more time with him but he said that he wanted
to go home and be in his own bed and think about everything that was going on because it was quite a lot and I definitely understood and did not blame
him he then left and sent me a message afterwards thanking you for being so understanding and I told him that I
would always be there for him if he needed literally anything point being everything that happened in the hotel
room was 100% consensual and this is confirmed I said yes by the only two
parties that were actually they are being myself and Sam after this night Sam when I continued to talk for the
next several weeks at first it was really really great but I noticed that his feelings towards me and sexuality were kind of wavering
quite a lot and I came to the collusion that he needed to figure himself out and that I needed to move on because I kept
getting hurt last important note to keep in mind about the timeline of the whole situation on May 2nd Sam texted me from
his friend's phone saying that he was fully gay I needed to talk to me about something important I called him and
instead talking about that he asked me if I was talking to another guy at the same time that I was talking to him I was a little bit confused as to I as
being asked this but I did answer him honestly and then I asked him what made him come to conclusion with everything
to what she said I'm actually not fully okay after doing this a million times I was frustrated
and I hung up just to clarify so there are no further questions the point of including this screenshot is not to out
Clarification
Sam Sam texted me saying he was fully gay but it was a trap to get me on
FaceTime so he could illegally record the conversation to include in the video that he was planning later on like I
said at the end of the conversation I asked and how he came to this conclusion and then he told me he was not fully gay
to which I hung up out of frustration later on he texted me saying he was confirmed by this is why in Sam's video
he included a screenshot of me telling him I did not think he was fully straight this comment had a lot of
people really up and confused as to why I was telling somebody their sexuality but there's a very simple explanation Stan when I
talked for a very very long time and his sexuality like I said wavered a lot every time that he was a little bit
confused we had open and honest conversations about it and he always asked me of my input and I gave it to
him I would never out somebody and I have never ever tried to manipulate somebody's sexuality including his
point-blank period the whole situation that happened with Sam was very very long and complicated and left both of us
very hurt and confused and through trying to do this I reached out to many of my different friends for advice um
there was one night in my kitchen where Tatia James and Gabriel all came over and I told them the same exact story and
showed them the same exact screenshots to all of you guys just saw after hearing this like Tati said in her video
Tati and James actually did have a heart-to-heart conversation with me about the boys that I could involve with they told me that talking to curious
guys was going to continue to get me hurt and that also it could look really really bad from an outside perspective if somebody tried to manipulate the
situation and for me this is a major major wake-up call that I took to heart because I honestly had never thought
about it and any other way because I knew that everything that I was doing was always consensual between both me and the boy and I had receipts to back
it up but I wished I knew at the time that Todd his advice was really a warning because she did exactly what she
told me someone else may which was telling my story with no details no facts and no proof and twisted around
and now serious allegations have surfaced that could permanently damage my career now like I said the talk that
happened in my kitchen I really did appreciate because it was the first time I kind of took a step back and was able to analyze what was going on and this
week has been a major eye-opener for me as well I want to take a brief moment to talk about boys boys have obviously met
a talent that has been discussed quite in detail on my youtube channel and social media networks this is no secret
I wish it hadn't been but if I'm gonna talk about at one last time I definitely want to be open and honest with you guys
the ones who matter I got out of the closet as gay at age 12 which is honestly really really young to kind of
figure all of that out I have two other boys at school at the time who were gay but we were all close friends so nothing
was happening there if you know what I mean but all my other friends were having their first kiss underneath the playground slide or getting into their
first relationship and talking all about it and for me I was on poptropica and social media networks trying to make
friends and trying to find out what else I was interested in I never really got the opportunity to experiment with love
and learn from that as a growing teenager and I think that that's honestly left me kind of underdeveloped as a person in a lot of different ways
I've been forced to grow very very quickly because of the job that I work in in social media which I know excited million times beforehand but love and
relationships is something that I have barely any experience in and I honestly think that that's why I'm a lot less
mature than others maybe in the situations that I get myself into um I definitely am emotional and I like it
the best me sometimes I can be dramatic I'm reactive I'm forward I'm flirty and
these are qualities that I'm not necessarily proud of at all but I can
confidently say that with each experience I'm learning more and more and I've been able to better myself but
a lot of times these situations have become public my own fault my own fault
but having millions of people watching you learn can be very very tricky when
it comes to experiences that I've learned from in the past a lot of times I've talked about being in two straight guys now this conversation is saying
that has upset and also confused quite a lot of people so in order to provide a little bit more context I would like to
play a clip from Todd his friend Jeffrey Starr's video titled the truth about my relationship but a single for a long time and the reason why is because I am
really not attracted to anyone but what we call in this world as a straight male
or a normal dude and what I mean by that is like you know I am really into
straight guys and I know that is going to not be surprising to a lot of you so
you know from just travelling everywhere and meeting dudes all the time and being around that world for so long I really
kind of fell into a trap of always being someone that was kept like the secret
and when you are someone like me who is you know I get asked all the time even every day on my channel you guys I get
comments are you a guy are you a girl are you transgender are you trying to transition what are you being someone
that is like me that is a guy that looks like a woman right I keep doing this
because so many people are not into labels these days and I love that I'm all about that you do you call yourself
whatever you want whatever you believe in I think that is the beauty and the freedom of you know living is we can be
whoever we want to be I have always been into straight men and the problem with that my entire life is I never found
real love because straight men behind closed doors they love people like me they love hooking up they love having
fun they love the relationship as long as other people don't know I really like the stuff from Jeffrey's video because
not only is everything in it very accurate but I honestly feel like he did a great job of explaining a topic that
is very confusing and complex and then not a lot of people understand including me fully to be honest yes as a gay man I
am attracted to men and in the past whenever I have found a guy cute on Instagram or on social media I have
stood in the dm's of the simple hello or a nice compliment if anybody ever made it clear that they were not interested
or were not gay and didn't want to talk I always apologized for the unwanted attention and the conversation was put
to a halt immediately I do take full responsibility for sending these messages in this situation has
definitely taught me that sending messages that are so for and direct like this are unacceptable and I no longer
will do that moving forward a few different guys that I've talked to in the past have since came forward with their stories or posted screenshots of
conversations that I had with them saying that I made them feel uncomfortable and reading some of them I honestly felt really really bad I
reached out to all the boys directly and apologize to them for my actions but aside from those few guys people are
Stereotypes
treating a hashtag Jam Chavez over party as an open invitation to add to the narrative with lies which is not only
harmful to me but it's also creating very very dangerous stereotypes around
the lgbtq+ community for example zara larsson who's a pretty big singer tweeted saying that i messaged her
boyfriend multiple times knowing he was straight and this tweak on almost half a
million likes before it was deleted in her defense she did later on say there was only one message but it was way too
late because the media had already ran with it saying that I was harassing straight men and wouldn't leave him alone had I known that he was dating
zara larsson I clearly never would have messaged him in the first place but this is all very hypocritical considering and this is how's our Larson found her
boyfriend I'd like to pose a question to you the audience why is it okay for zara larsson a woman
with the public platform to tweet these photos of a shirtless man and say who are you where do you live how old are
you why are you so fine how do you like your eggs cooked in the morning but for me as a gay man to DM the same person in
private with a simple compliment is predatory these stereotypes are on gay men had been and continue to be very
very harmful to the community and have been historically used to villainize gay men in society someone completely
fabricated a whole entire story about me touching another boy at a high school Journal and it blew up this person that
came forward a few days later saying that it was a social experiment but it
was too late people also completely photoshopped Twitter DMS of me reaching out to these people threatening legal
action if they were to tweet more things when in reality I have literally not even met on social media and I deleted
the Twitter app from my phone so all these things are just so false and are so fake and it's truly disgusting
also pretty much every boy that I've ever even communicated with at this point is posting screenshots of our conversation at to make a spectacle of
me I've dealt with so many fake stories in the past from Coachella the fake sex tape and now this and I'm done I'm done
being the subject of these bandwagon stories for length it's not okay now that we've addressed and cleared the air
on the boys let's get back to our Thailand because somehow there's still a whole lot more to this story and more
claims as well in toc2 video she said that she felt she needed to bring all this to the public eye because people
need to just know what's going on behind the scenes and I truly cannot believe that I'm about to bring up what I'm going to bring up but I feel the same
exact way on Monday May sex that Jeffrey posted this tweet to his twitter which i honestly started getting tagged in after
this tweet and a few other ones from him and his friends i decided to reach out to him and asked if there was something going on and that i should be aware of
he replied to me and he said that it was not about me and that it was about another brand stealing his ideas this message was in a voice memo which has
since disappeared from the screenshot you'll just have to believe me I have literally no reason to lie at this point even though he said it wasn't about me I
still asked to talk to him but he said he was unavailable a few hours later while I was getting ready to forth and
back down this text from Jeffrey concerned but mostly really really confused I reached
out to him about meeting together in private and hopes to speak together and figure out the best understanding but he didn't reply
three days later still no response I decided to reach out again but he was not available to talk I flew to
Australia on May 8th and on May 10th hours before my scheduled meeting reappearance where five thousand fans were already waiting outside I was open
up at four in the morning by my friend because Tonti had just uploaded a video titled by a sister watching talk to his
video it was very clear to me that my friend was still very hurt and even though I had already apologized both privately and publicly I wanted to make
a video right then and there with my raw and honest emotions but because of the time difference it took me the extra few
hours to film the video and get it up and by the time I was abou"

- We got gummi poop emojis.
- No!
(dramatic music)
- [Devan] Uh!
- Wait, what?
Oh, my God, those are unicorn poops.
(crunching)
Hey, yo guys, this is the gummy food
versus real food challenge, part four.
You guys challenged us and we are back at it again,
so right now...
- It's so good. - Lemme try this.
(crunching) (spitting)
The eyeball, choked on a piece of paper.
- This is so good, though.
- Let's go to the next one.
(spitting)
- [Devan] All right. (bell ringing three times)
- [Together] Three, two, one, done!
Ohhh!
- Oh, gosh, no.
It took me a second.
I was, like, oh, great gummy, bad pepper.
Good gummy, bad pepper.
And then I remembered, bad gummy.
- That's a big pepper.
- 'Cause these thing is spicy.
This might be spicy, this is spicy.
Ahhh!
Why'd I chew it so much?
(beep)
Ready? - Not so ready. Cheers?
- Three, two, one. (crunching)
- This isn't bad at all.
- It's sorta bad.
- Is yours spicy? - A little bit.
- Mine's not spicy at all.
- We wanna go to the next level, which is a red pepper?
- Um, sure?
- And then we're gonna end off with the orange pepper.
I did the orange pepper before.
That one's terrible.
Ahhhh!
- Cheers. - Cheers.
All right.
- Oh. - OK.
- Turn up the heat like a million times.
- This is a gummy.
Why is it so spicy?
- My lips are on fire!
What kind of pepper is this?
Ahhhh!
My lips!
- We're goin' for the final one right here, bro.
- I'm not doin' that.
- Three, two, one, wait, wait, wait.
First I gotta challenge.
I wanna see, can you subscribe to this channel,
turn on the channel post notifications.
- Ah, now?
- And give us a thumbs up in seven seconds.
We gotta do this quick, otherwise Devan's gonna pass out.
Here we go.
- [Together] Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, done.
If you can do that, comment down below,
give us one right now.
Here we go, guys, three!
Two, one. (crunching)
- Ohh! Ohh!
- I'm gonna all do at once.
- I feel like an oven.
- Oh, my God, hot, bro.
Hot.
- I just swallowed it.
- You're good?
- No, it hurts to breathe.
- I feel like a dragon.
My face is all sweaty.
Next round, here we go.
Are you good or no?
- That hurts so bad.
I need some milk.
- [Collins] All right, you got some milk?
- Got the almond milk.
- This man needs some milk.
It's almond milk.
Does it work the same?
- Sweet relief.
- Bro, your lips are actually kinda red.
(bell ringing three times)
Devan is actually still feeling it after that last one,
so hopefully you get a gummy,
'cause Devan's gotten no gummies this entire time.
- My lips are so red, please be a gummy.
- Here we go, three, two, one.
- Yo! - Hey, yo.
- This is gonna be awesome.
- We have been blessed, bro.
- I'm hopin' this soothes my pain.
(elastic stretching sound effect)
This tastes really good.
This was much needed.
Ahhh!
How's yours? - Huh?
- How does it compare to the malic acid watermelon?
Ahhhh! - Ahhhh!
- My lip is burning.
- How dare you make me remember such
a tough time in my life?
(slapping) (coughing)
(crunching)
- Still as good as the rest of the watermelon?
You OK?
(bell ringing three times)
- This one smells really good.
- This smells really good.
- Like pure sugar and deliciousness.
- All right?
- [Together] Three, two, one, yo!
(voices overlapping)
- [Collins] Breakfast, but gummies.
- [Devan] Dude, this is gonna be legit.
I'm so hungry.
- Whooo!
Yo, this is like the most detailed waffle ever, bro.
Even the butter is gummy.
(sniffing) (sighing)
The best smelling egg in the entire world.
Bro, smell your egg.
- Ugh. (coughs)
This is tough, this is tough.
I'm sorry, I have to get into your space.
- Bro, whatcha doin', fam?
This is actually suggested by the Instagram
Keyper of the Week who said
we should do breakfast food gummies
and if you wanna be featured as
the Instagram Keyper of the Week,
check the description down below
and right now, I wanna see how this egg tastes.
I'm about to go Beast Mode and bite directly into the yolk
of the egg, Devan.
- All right, go for it.
- Wish me luck. - All right.
- I may never come back.
(elastic stretching sound effect)
- I guess that kinda works.
- The yolk's on me.
(laughing) (rim shot)
- Dude, are you OK?
- I'm Gucci, bro. (beep)
- OK, so now that I've tried this real waffle,
I want to see how it compares to that gummy one.
All right, here it goes.
(elastic stretching sound effect)
- Bro, that face was so intense.
Mmm, oh God, this is so good.
- That's real good, I'm gonna try.
- Yo, this is the greatest gummy breakfast of all time,
because breakfast is already super delicious,
but the gummy version, hoo, next level.
- Let's go to the...
- Next, let's go to the...
- Next. - One.
(bell ringing three times)
So far, except for the peppers,
they've all been really good,
and I hope it stays that way.
- I do, too.
- [Collins] One!
- Yo! I love pickles!
Pickles are awesome.
I love the attention to detail.
- [Collins] Yeah.
- [Devan] There's bumps on it and everything.
This looks really awesome.
- OK, is the gummy truly pickled, though?
- I don't know. - Ready?
- All right.
(quirky music)
(creepy music)
This is really weird.
This is like they tried to make a tasty gummy,
but they also tried to make it a pickle,
and so there's just really conflicting flavors on it.
- Can I try it? - Go for it.
- Oh, yeah, that's weird.
- It's like they tried to make it sweet,
but they tried to make it a pickle at the same time.
- It woulda taste like a pickle, but it's a gummy.
- Mm-hmm.
- That was a terrible business before, maybe a great one.
- Huh. - Uh.
I'm gonna eat the rest of my pickle, though.
Actually, I forgot how much I love pickles.
(upbeat Hawaiian music)
(record scratching)
Oh, like we're goin' to the next one.
(beep)
You know what?
We should actually reintroduce the Keep It or Switch It.
- Let's do it.
- Devan, want to keep 'em or switch 'em?
It's up to you.
- Uh, this is tough, this is tough.
Uhhh, I wanna switch 'em.
- OK. - Why not?
- [Together] Three, two, one, yo!
- [Collins] Wait, what?
- Dude, it's a mustache.
That's hilarious.
You've gotta put it on or eat it,
'cause those are both equally gross.
- Yeah, I'm definitely gonna opt for the not-eating it,
'cause... - Yep, all right.
Well, I'm gonna eat mine.
(quirky music)
It is really soft.
Ah, I have a hair in my eye.
- Is it from me mustache?
Ooooh.
That just put a hair in your eye from a mustache.
Ma beed.
I'm not excited about this, all right.
Oh, that's so tickly.
- Dude, it looks great.
- It's my mustache.
- It should be your new style. (ding)
- What?
- You should wear this for the rest of the video.
- Nooo way! No, no no!
- You can't take it off.
- What?
- You can't take it off. - No.
Dude, this is not fair.
- I won't allow it.
- Hey, no.
It's really tacky.
Think it's not comin' off.
All right, guys, I guess we're goin' on to the next one.
This was the worst deal ever.
(bell ringing three times)
- All right, Collins, it's your turn.
Do you wanna keep or switch?
- Hmmm.
(laughing)
I'm going to switch.
- You're gonna switch, all right.
- Last time didn't work out,
so hopefully, this time, it works out.
- All right, here we go.
- [Together] Three, two, one, oh!
- It's corn.
- It's a corn on a stick.
- This does not look cooked.
- [Collins] Bro, this gummy corn looks delicious.
- [Devan] Oh, no.
Why are you eating like that?
Nobody eats corn on the cob like that.
(gagging)
- Look at all those hairs on there, bro.
- [Devan] Oh, that's so gross.
- There's hairs in my food.
- OK, well I'm gonna teach you
how to properly eat corn.
Take it from one end
(crunching)
to the other.
I didn't want to eat it.
It's so uncooked.
- It's so uncooked.
- It tastes gross.
- Your unrealistic standards for corn, Devan.
It's just, it's just unbelievable.
All right, you ready?
(quirky music)
- You know, you take bites out of it,
I was just doing. - There's a hair.
- There you go.
Just a lot faster, like a chipmunk.
Yeah, nice.
- I don't have, like, razor blades for teeth,
so I can't hook.
- Do chipmunks have razor blades for teeth?
Whoa!
- The gummy kinda tastes like corn in a way.
- [Devan] I'll take your word for it.
There's too many hairs on there for me to try it.
- Well, go to the next one.
I broke my stick.
- [Devan] Oh, no.
- [Togther] Ohhh!
- It's really broken, now.
This is, (bell ringing three times)
the final round,
and so, for this one,
we're goin' big or we're goin' home.
I don't know what it is.
All I know, it's gonna be crazy.
You wanna switch or stay?
- Uhhhh, I'll stay.
- Three. - Two.
- What a fateful decision.
- [Together] One.
- Yo. We got screwed.
- Wait, how does that make sense?
It's a brain.
- Dude, they're Smarties.
See? Get it?
- Oh, like they're smart like a brain is smart.
- Uh-huh. - Hoo!
Bro, you got so lucky.
Could you imagine if that were a real brain right there?
- That would be terrifying.
- Oh, my gosh, yo.
This is like the biggest gummy I have ever seen
in my life.
(slapping) Oww!
I'm about to take a bite of my brain,
or the brain, a brain.
The brain. (beep)
I'm gonna eat the giant gummy brain right now.
Devan will be happy with the Smarties,
and if you wanna be featured in the next video,
comment down below what normal food,
like pizza, like hamburgers, I don't know,
McDonald's food...
- Toxic waste. - Toxic waste,
sour candy, Warheads.
What should we turn into a giant gummy?
Let us know in the comments down below and be featured,
but right now, Devan, you ready?
- I'm ready.
- Well, there you go.
Three, I don't know where you bite it from,
two, can I take my mustache off?
- No.
- One.
- That seems really difficult.
- Bro, my brain is very tough.
(elastic stretching sound effect)
Mmm. - How is it?
- Mmm. - What?
elastic stretching sound effect)
- I feel smarter already.
All right, bye.
- Bye.
(ripping sound) - Ohh!
I sound like Chewbacca.
(roaring)
Chewbacca. (beep)

[Music]
everybody knows that no Foods permitted
during the class and still who doesn't
want to break the rule watch this video
for a few tricks on how to sneak a snack
into class
[Music]
sometimes I want to chew on something
during class I've got apples and my
friends got candies
But the teacher isn't happy to see a
little picnic in her class would you
like a piece of Apple she seems to get
nothing except knowledge
remember well no Foods allowed in class
at least for the students
Chocolate Pencil Case
do you think it's a colored pencil case
it's actually not let's see what's
inside we'll need a colored pencil case
cut off the top part of a pencil
repeat for the others hot glue the
cutout to the top part of the case from
the inside
attach all the others in the same way
case looks like it's full of pencils
open the bottom
put in a bar of chocolate
[Music]
close the case it looks exactly like it
used to it seems my friend can't open
her colored pencil case I offer her mine
but she isn't going to draw there's a
dream of a sweet tooth inside her case
oh heck Miss Smith has noted it you
should have broken off a little piece
well here again you're well aware that
no food's allowed does anyone see aha
well they are busy mocking me I'll snack
on their chocolate teachers sometimes
need a sweet compensation for their
students behavior
Notebooks
do you dream of a portion of french
fries or a juicy cheeseburger during
your long classes take bright notebooks
shaped like a pack of french fries and a
cheeseburger we've shown how to make
them in our previous videos
Miss Smith wears glasses she thinks
we've got McDonald's here
we assure her it's nothing like that
it's just our weird notebooks it's a
kind of Mac School
well Miss Smith is cleaning her
eyeglasses we change the notebooks for
the real snacks hmm what crispy french
fries and a tasty cheeseburger are you
eating again oh yes it's your notebooks
okay continue writing girls they are so
creative foreign
Marker
this marker doesn't write is it another
prank no it's my way to sneak a snack
into class
take off a plug from the marker remove
the filling
clean the inside of the container
put in gummy bears
set the plug
[Music]
my friend tries in vain to write with my
marker I explain it's not for writing
it's a place to hide my little Gummy
Bears she likes the idea so much she's
left me an empty marker
[Music]
Sausages
I managed to sneak sausages into my art
class how did I do that here's the hack
put a sausage in a Ziploc bag
heat a knife above the flame cut off the
bag to fit the sausage size the hot
knife seals the package while cutting
through it take out a few wipes from the
pack to get some free space
tuck the packed sausages in it
I like to eat my sausages with some
sauce let's disguise it as gouache fill
a clean gouache container with ketchup
put on the top
add mayonnaise in another container
be careful not to mix up the sauce and
the paint
the gouache in a pack of wet wipes are
usual supplies in painting class and no
one suspects there's something else
inside I take a sausage from the white
package my friend is bewildered why did

TED,"23,700,000","2,622,785,993","4,554",People & Blogs,2006,"So in college,
I was a government major,
which means I had to write a lot of papers.
Now, when a normal student writes a paper,
they might spread the work out a little like this.
So, you know --
(Laughter)
you get started maybe a little slowly,
but you get enough done in the first week
that, with some heavier days later on,
everything gets done, things stay civil.
(Laughter)
And I would want to do that like that.
That would be the plan.
I would have it all ready to go,
but then, actually, the paper would come along,
and then I would kind of do this.
(Laughter)
And that would happen every single paper.
But then came my 90-page senior thesis,
a paper you're supposed to spend a year on.
And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option.
It was way too big a project.
So I planned things out,
and I decided I kind of had to go something like this.
This is how the year would go.
So I'd start off light,
and I'd bump it up in the middle months,
and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear
just like a little staircase.
How hard could it be to walk up the stairs?
No big deal, right?
But then, the funniest thing happened.
Those first few months?
They came and went,
and I couldn't quite do stuff.
So we had an awesome new revised plan.
(Laughter)
And then --
(Laughter)
But then those middle months actually went by,
and I didn't really write words,
and so we were here.
And then two months turned into one month,
which turned into two weeks.
And one day I woke up
with three days until the deadline,
still not having written a word,
and so I did the only thing I could:
I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,
pulling not one but two all-nighters --
humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters --
sprinted across campus,
dove in slow motion,
and got it in just at the deadline.
I thought that was the end of everything.
But a week later I get a call,
and it's the school.
And they say, ""Is this Tim Urban?""
And I say, ""Yeah.""
And they say, ""We need to talk about your thesis.""
And I say, ""OK.""
And they say,
""It's the best one we've ever seen.""
(Laughter)
(Applause)
That did not happen.
(Laughter)
It was a very, very bad thesis.
(Laughter)
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought,
""This guy is amazing!""
(Laughter)
No, no, it was very, very bad.
Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.
I write the blog Wait But Why.
And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me,
and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world
what goes on in the heads of procrastinators,
and why we are the way we are.
Now, I had a hypothesis
that the brains of procrastinators were actually different
than the brains of other people.
And to test this, I found an MRI lab
that actually let me scan both my brain
and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator,
so I could compare them.
I actually brought them here to show you today.
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.
I know that if you're not a trained brain expert,
it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?
So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
(Laughter)
Now ...
here's my brain.
(Laughter)
There is a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them,
but the procrastinator's brain
also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?
Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.
[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]
So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision
to do something productive,
but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,
so he actually takes the wheel,
and he says, ""Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page
of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal,
because I just remembered that that happened.
(Laughter)
Then --
(Laughter)
Then we're going to go over to the fridge,
to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.
After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral
that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets
and ends much, much later with us watching interviews
with Justin Bieber's mom.
(Laughter)
""All of that's going to take a while,
so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today.
Sorry!""
(Sigh)
Now, what is going on here?
The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy
you want behind the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future,
and he only cares about two things:
easy and fun.
Now, in the animal world, that works fine.
If you're a dog
and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things,
you're a huge success!
(Laughter)
And to the Monkey,
humans are just another animal species.
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation,
which in tribal times might have worked OK.
But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.
We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.
Which is why we have another guy in our brain,
the Rational Decision-Maker,
who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.
We can visualize the future.
We can see the big picture.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all of that into account.
And he wants to just have us do
whatever makes sense to be doing right now.
Now, sometimes it makes sense
to be doing things that are easy and fun,
like when you're having dinner or going to bed
or enjoying well-earned leisure time.
That's why there's an overlap.
Sometimes they agree.
But other times, it makes much more sense
to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant,
for the sake of the big picture.
And that's when we have a conflict.
And for the procrastinator,
that conflict tends to end a certain way every time,
leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone,
an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.
I call it the Dark Playground.
(Laughter)
Now, the Dark Playground is a place
that all of you procrastinators out there know very well.
It's where leisure activities happen
at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.
The fun you have in the Dark Playground
isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned,
and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred --
all of those good procrastinator feelings.
And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel,
how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone,
a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?
Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel,
someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him
in his darkest moments --
someone called the Panic Monster.
(Laughter)
Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time,
but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close
or there's danger of public embarrassment,
a career disaster or some other scary consequence.
And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of.
Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently,
because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago
and invited me to do a TED Talk.
(Laughter)
Now, of course, I said yes.
It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But in the middle of all this excitement,
the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.
He was saying, ""Are we clear on what we just accepted?
Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?
We need to sit down and work on this right now.""
And the Monkey said, ""Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth
and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground,
and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country,
so we can get a better feel for India.""
(Laughter)
So that's what we did that day.
(Laughter)
As six months turned into four and then two and then one,
the people of TED decided to release the speakers.
And I opened up the website, and there was my face
staring right back at me.
And guess who woke up?
(Laughter)
So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind,
and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.
(Laughter)
And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster --
boom, he's up the tree!
And finally,
finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel
and I can start working on the talk.
Now, the Panic Monster explains
all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior,
like how someone like me could spend two weeks
unable to start the opening sentence of a paper,
and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic
to stay up all night and write eight pages.
And this entire situation, with the three characters --
this is the procrastinator's system.
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.
When I did, I was amazed by the response.
Literally thousands of emails came in,
from all different kinds of people from all over the world,
doing all different kinds of things.
These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers
and lots and lots of PhD students.
(Laughter)
And they were all writing, saying the same thing:
""I have this problem too.""
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post
and the heaviness of these emails.
These people were writing with intense frustration
about what procrastination had done to their lives,
about what this Monkey had done to them.
And I thought about this, and I said,
well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?
Why are all of these people in such a dark place?
Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.
Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given,
they all have deadlines.
And when there's deadlines,
the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term
because the Panic Monster gets involved.
But there's a second kind of procrastination
that happens in situations when there is no deadline.
So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter --
something in the arts, something entrepreneurial --
there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening,
not until you've gone out and done the hard work
to get momentum, get things going.
There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career
that don't involve any deadlines,
like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health,
working on your relationship
or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things
is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,
because in all of these non-deadline situations,
the Panic Monster doesn't show up.
He has nothing to wake up for,
so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained;
they just extend outward forever.
And it's this long-term kind of procrastination
that's much less visible and much less talked about
than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind.
It's usually suffered quietly and privately.
And it can be the source
of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.
And I thought, that's why those people are emailing,
and that's why they're in such a bad place.
It's not that they're cramming for some project.
It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator,
at times, in their own lives.
The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams;
it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.
So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany --
that I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators.
Now, you might not all be a mess,
like some of us,
(Laughter)
and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines,
but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick
is when the deadlines aren't there.
Now, I want to show you one last thing.
I call this a Life Calendar.
That's one box for every week of a 90-year life.
That's not that many boxes,
especially since we've already used a bunch of those.
So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.
We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on,
because everyone is procrastinating on something in life.
We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
That's a job for all of us.
And because there's not that many boxes on there,
it's a job that should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but ...
(Laughter)
You know.
Sometime soon.
Thank you.

next 24 hours we're gonna be breaking
rules at places like the water park
trampoline park zoo and many more if i
get kicked out of any of these places
more than three times i have to shave my
head not getting kicked out is gonna be
insanely hard because some of the rules
we're breaking are ridiculous starting

getting hurt
you're almost there
we're done the rule's broken oh and so
is my neck no hanging on the basketball
rim
[Music]
that's not what i meant when i said hang
on it but that is way cooler we've
already broken so many rules so far but
there is one problem there's a security
guard that patrols this entire mall and
if he looks under those windows and sees
us we're screwed and we lose a lot
always land on two feet don't land on
your feet here we go
oh belly
belly
so we literally have one more little
break we just saw someone walk in
[Music]
it looks like a security guard if we
want to break this last world we have to
be careful and really quick no digging
in the foam pit you shut up okay let's
go let's go
shut up oh my bad we gotta be quick yo
oh my god what dare you to eat that it's
probably been here for like a month oh
oh
oh that's so bad just hit me in the face
okay what are you guys doing park's been
close for two hours you and you out of
the phone pit let's go we have to leave
right now yes kicked out literally the
first location we've been to
the rules we're breaking are going to
keep getting crazier and crazier make
sure you watch the end to see if i have
to shave my head or not sorry okay i'm
not going to lie you're on the
rollerblades it's kind of cool but you
guys got to go i'm sorry
okay we're
this guy was really cool we gotta go
because we're breaking all these rules
we're gonna give every security worker
some money and we're still getting
kicked out we're currently at brent's to
break all the rules at his house i don't
want to do this forever because he hates
people break the rules it's gonna be a
lot of fun brandon's not home right now
so i have to sneak in and break the
rules well number one no shoes on the
bed
it's a party one number one broken i'm
jumping on brent's bed with my dirty
shoes if brent would have caught me
breaking that last roll he would have
killed me but anyways next on the list
is do not leave trash anywhere got a
banana peel right here would be a shame
if i just uh threw it
frank gets especially mad about this one
and it's to not eat his food brent's
favorite cereal is right here look how
many he has we're doing more than
breaking the rules we're like literally
robbing him right now incoming oh my
god i made a giant cereal bowl with all
of brent's favorite cereal if he walks
in right now i am literally dead
absolutely nothing crazy in the house
how about a
bounce house in one of his rooms
we blew a bounce house in one of brent's
rooms and i just saw his car pull up
lock the door lock the door there's no
lock on it
what is this you can't put a bounce
house in this room before he kicks me
out i gotta break a few more rules no
one of the biggest rules is that i am
banned for life is any of his toilets
you're not used to like no
oh my god
all right let's keep going oh in the
backyard oh wait no no hey oh let's go
no ben you're not allowed to do any

get kicked out more than three times i
have to shave my head yeah you're kicked

two strikes down we gotta go to some
more places break some more rules
hopefully don't get kicked out again
because i'm not shaving my head there's
a rule on youtube that i want you guys
to break and it's that you can't
subscribe with your nose so break the
rule and help us get to 100. we're about
to go to the zoo i've gotten kicked out

thank you i'm not saying thank you i'm
waiting okay thank you whatever leave
leave all right my job here is done
she's never come here ever again i've
already broken so many rules but none of
them come to us crazy as the rules that
the water bar starting with don't have
your clothes or towels on the railing
got my shirt got my towel one two rule
number one broken there are so many
lifeguards at this water park you see
one literally everywhere you look so
it'd be very quiet because i'm currently
on my last slide i get caught today at
the water park i have to shave my head
the first rule is no double flips on the
giant water slide are you allowed to do
double flips here
fingers crossed guys
oh my god here we go
oh my god that hurts so freaking bad so
far so good we haven't gotten caught the
lifeguard is looking at me right now so
we go the other side of the waterpark
break some more rules there then come
back there's a rule that you can't run
across the giant hot dog let's go
i see why they don't want you to run
across it
that just happened girls just trying to
make it to the other side what do you
mean you can only wear a bathing suit on
the slides wait i have an idea three two
one
we might be in trouble after this one
he's literally recording us
another rule broken we look so
ridiculous we're currently on the other
side of the water park because one of
the lifeguards is taking photos of us
which means he's trying to get us kicked
out i'm not gonna shave my head so we're
over here to break some more rules can't
eat food while going down a slide got a
banana let's go
here we go
boy i also fell out of the tube which is
breaking another rule that you can't get
out of the two mid-rise the rule that
you can't get a running start into the
slide i feel like there's a reason why
this is a rule oh we're gonna break it
anyways
oh i see why they don't want you to run
into the slide i told you that was gonna
hurt i wanted to try it out for myself
one of the biggest rules at all water
parks is you can't go down the slide
when you're pregnant we do have to break
100 rules so i'm pregnant and i'm going
down the slide we literally have it
posted right here this one might get us
kicked out we got to be careful if
you're pregnant and you go down the
slide
okay can i please go down all right
yes it still is breaking a rule but
they're letting us do this one we're not
getting kicked out yet oh i'm about to
give birth
i see why they don't want you to go down
when you're pregnant it is really hard
you're only supposed to go one at a time
on the slide so we got three at a time
with three people on this slide you go
way too fast oh you know what hit me but
that hurts so freaking bad i'm not
allowed to run up the slide
my whole body's in pain right now i see
why that's a room next rule no going
down backwards mason got this
wait
oh my god let's get out of here back to
the other side next rule is no running
here we go
we also just broke the rule of no
hurting your friends i'm so sorry mason
lifeguard's distracted

the venue for one of nature's most
astonishing hunts
it's an unusual face-off
in one corner the cobra
spectacle cobras can grow up to more
than seven feet in length
their venom attacks the nerves which can
kill a human in as little as 30 minutes
cobras are normally shy but when
threatened they can become very
aggressive
especially when a furry predator starts
sniffing around
in the other corner the mongoose
at first glance this curious mammal may
not look like much competition for a
cobra
but the indian grey mongoose is quite
the predator itself and its lightning
fast reflexes and thick hide have
enabled it to add snakes like the cobra
to its list of favored foods
the snake tries to warn the mongoose
away
making use of that famous hood and raspy
hiss
but the mongoose is persistent and on
the hunt
when the mongoose moves into attack the
cobra strikes
and misses
again
and again
each time the mongoose dances just out
of reach
but when the mongoose attacks he doesn't
miss
snake will be on the menu tonight

in the cockpit there's even a little guy
next to you wait okay this is nuts
that's actually really cool if I had
that as a kid I would be doing that all
day guys the next Avengers trailer just
dropped look at this oh it looks so sick
there's Spider-Man opening a microwave
there's Spider-Man again getting a spoon
yeah this is a cool Gadget though I
would be down for this I would
definitely just shoot it at like my mom
or something and I don't know it' be
funny where can I buy one of these
things that looks that actually looks
pretty sick would you like to return to
Nature after you die well this may be
the answer it's the world's first living
coffin and it's made from mushrooms made
by Dutch company Luke biotch we finding
natural ways to return human nutrients
to the soil the beds are grown in just
and use local mushrooms upcycled hemp
fibers to create a Sol carry up to
200 because alive it hugely accelerates
the decomposition rate meaning you can
return to Nature in just 45 days also
offer a mycelium n which helps transform
human ashes into New Life um it's cool
yeah maybe I don't know it's a little
creepy like you'll just walk past that
tree every day and be like that's my
freaking cousin Timmy like frck a little
interesting it's kind of cool though
ways we currently treat our dead
negatively impact the planet by causing
deforestation for casket wood emitting
greenhouse gases during cremation and
introducing non biodegradable materal
enir but utilizing things like my celium
which can help return our bodies to the
soil could be a much better option hey I
mean it's kind of cool is pretty cool
interesting that's the future of dying
again I invented the lonely lounger the
full body companion for enjoying all of
your favorite shows in bed you have no
one else to watch them with for all you
single people there you go you got a
cuddle buddy with a phone holder SL into
the that's kind of sick now you just
need to put on your favorite sh that's
actually sick I I do like that I
wouldn't say that's useless this is the
guy that does useless inventions but
that's pretty freaking useful a
urinal what is this with a screen you
can you can play fortnite while peeing
heck yeah no it says it's a urinal
Health test in public the test is
completed directly in the Ural and the
result is sent to this is so germy
though people are going to be touching
their and then touching the screen I'm
good I'm good I'm so good why would you
do that that's weird why on the jural
like what this guy has one of the
biggest keyboards in the world look at
this dude just setting it up at at his
office playing some playing some
Minecraft it's so loud how is he going
to reach over here dude he needs the
numpad nope got to walk to it top 15
Amazon products I bought this month
top they catch the clippings inside the
handle which makes them easy to throw
away oh I like that like toilet paper
that is machine washable so you never
waste paper reusable toilet paper that
you wash no you lost me you completely
lost he's got poop on his hand as well
oh Nutella but come on this is not okay
you should not be doing this this washer
is just going to be filled with poop
where does a poop go disgusting no you
never waste I'm so good this is a citrus
rimmer and it's designed to help you get
out of your lemons and it can plug stuff
too storm matches that
can being covered in dirt and even being
held underwater so it will sa life this
smart bin automatically the bag when
it's full and replaces the I own this
one is pretty awesome or any design you
want on your coffee and is also great
this special brush sticks to the side of
your sink and makes it easy to clean any
size Cup this is a fake compartment
where you can hide your house find them
if your bread unraveling you can get
these clips that help keep your bread
fresh for longer this is a laundry easy
to get your laundry out of the
dishwasher and it folds up nicely which
prevents clothes from falling dishwasher
these are reusable straws that open up
when it's time to clean them and slide
back together when you're done this
chopping boards into three segments
making it super easy to slide your meat
into a pan and fruit into a bowl these
are food H and they're great for keeping
Foods fresh there's different sizes for
different foods so they fit super tight
why would you why like who's doing that
to a banana just eat it but hey it's
it's cool I guess these were decent
except the toilet paper reusable thingy
that was weird but okay so the same guy
got the stormproof matches and I want to
see if they actually freaking work
stormproof matches wrecked up a whopping
10 million views for apparently staying
lit after being dunked in a glass of
water so I quickly ordered for myself to
test and compare to normal matches from
the supermarket I started off by
grabbing my fan and setting it to
maximum power the blew out straight away
but the fan was no match for the stor
proof okay look how much big it is as
hard as I wow so it makes it stronger
Next Level was the dirt simulation test
and although the normal matches failed
miserably the stormproof ones just
refused to go out and survived again it
was time to step it up and dunk them in
water to see if was truly real I started
off with a Qui and they came straight
back to life so I went all in and held
them under my eyes they bubbled away
under the water and lit back up as soon
as I pulled them out dude this is the
perfect survival match like that's
insane how do you blow it out though say
you light it how you get rid of it can't
blow it out it'll just get stronger
can't put it in water it'll still burn
what are you supposed to do phone case
that lets you play games on it I can't
believe I'm lit playing Pac-Man on a
freaking phone case get get away get
away get away why play Pac-Man on your
phone when you can play it on the back
of your phone on your phone case still
pretty cool though the ultimate Berry
catcher look at this dude who's picking
berries anymore when you just do this
this is extremely genius and if people
are still picking berries one by one you
stupid all right this is crazy that's
actually nuts genius fish catcher it's a
smart device you put in the water and
you just pull up when the fish is nearby
and it catches it in a nice bowet and
it's safe for the fish I guess if you
just want to catch and release like look
at that Boop yoink that's pretty sick
that is cool I like that one you know
what make you a genius is if you click
that first link down below to cop the
new mystery plushy let's see what
mystery plushy I
get I got the zombie one now there's six
different ones and there's also a super
rare one so go check it out first link
down below there's a bunch of plushies
go C okay so this is a smart Gadget say
you have obstructed view there's
buildings in the way or you you just
don't have a view and it's stupid well
then what you can do is fake view very
interesting like this would be really
trippy walking into your house and
seeing this and you're like wait aren't
we in like a city now this would be
really cool if they somehow figure out a
way to make it like 3D looking cuz
obviously this would look very fake
still really nice like it's definitely
better than just a stupid wall or you
know a building like this is way cooler
so I I approve okay look at this mini
movie set I think this is like a movie
set type of thing but this is how they
do it they just build it miniature
version and then they film and it's so
much easier than paying for the real
thing like this is sick look at that it
looks real they did such a good job look
at that look at all the trees the
smartest
RV whoa what okay that is so cool dude
look at that get yourself a little
balcony area kind of there's your
table
wow and your bed's over there dude this
is sick oh he's got the TV look at that
look at the sunset dang 240p they're
showing me a futuristic RV show it to me
in 1080P at least why 240 so in Japan
they have desk chairs that fold into
beds so that they can nap during the day
afternoon naps dude I'm moving to Japan
I just need to buy a freaking nap chair
just like that'd be so nice look at this
thing dude it's a speaker that has a
that has a Venom thingy in it and it
moves to the beat oh I did purchase a
mini one of these but this is a giga one
it's just so viby dude it just dances
for you how the heck does this work it's
amazing here's an L-shaped pool table
for those expert pool players I guess
who want to challenge this is imagine
your balls here you have to trick shot I
like this actually this is this would
make it so much more interesting we have
a moving trampoline as if trampolines
weren't already dangerous enough without
a net of course uh here you go move it
with a tractor that's insane that would
actually be so fun but yeah very
dangerous look at this weird Gadget it's
like a 3D printed laser like it look
look you see the human walking in the
laser that's so weird what the heck
that's trippy this guy decided to build
a freaking Bluetooth speaker out of an
almond why I don't freaking know let's
just see how he does it so as you can
see he's like screwing it together
there's literally screws in this almond
and there's buttons those are buttons
right there to control the Bluetooth
speaker how did he do this it actually
works too look
paired it plays music like what it has a
charger USBC even like what is going on
dude it's playing kazuk kid dude that's
nuts I would definitely mistake this as
food and eat it probably and then choke
you know so I don't know interesting it'
also be very easy to lose but cool I
guess we have the ultimate pickle lifter
3000 for when you need to lift your
pickles out of the pickle juice Perfect
Dude yes this is what I'm talking about
all right that is a big issue that we
need to fix pickle juice you don't want
pickle juice on your fingers that's
nasty get the pickle lifter 3000 at at
every Walmart today here is a 1 million
Star Wars home theater I guess you can
buy it today at your nearest Target no
you can't um but this is interesting for
those Giga Star Wars fans who only want
to watch Star Wars in their home theater
you want to watch Lord of the Rings you
can't idiot go to the Lord of the Rings
million-dollar theater not the Star Wars
one we're only watching Star Wars here
this is pretty cool obviously but a
little too much I think I mean Star Wars
is good I guess I liked the older the
old ones the most oh the that chair dude
oh that's cool that is cool that is cool
who gets to sit there dang the freaking
Throne I like that look at this cool
coin all right some guy modif finded a
Morgan silver dollar and look he even
put a a a hidden button that opens up
the hand how the heck do you build this
contraption in such a small little piece
of silver like what so cool here is a
circular pingpong table or tube I guess
dude this would be intense you could
bounce it off the ceiling bounce off the
walls this would make pingpong much more
interesting I would watch it if this was
on TV with freaking tube pingpong tubes
yeah dude AI pin it's a standalone
device software platform built from the
ground up for AI engagement comes
through your voice touch gesture the
lasering
display what Play the song how music
makes you feel better they muted it it's
copyright good they already muted it for
me so you just have to go like this
these almonds have 15 g of protein what
the heck so it's like a little Siri
that's on your chest we
tap staying in the moment okay wait like
this is cool cuz you could record things
and you don't have to be on your phone
you could just instead of getting out
your phone trying to go to the camera
you know I do like that I think in the
future this could definitely work better
like if it like when it upgrades has
really good camera you know stuff like
that for now I don't I don't think that
will be big yet but in the future could
be I think if they make it into like
contacts or like glasses yes 100% I
think contacts is the future of phones
like I don't know I feel like put in a
contact and you you just touch you know
the air and I just feel like that'd be
crazy we have a bike that's for
parrots what the
heck your parrot getting too fat give
him this you'll be jacked in the legs in
no time look at how ahead we were 100
years ago to go look at this this this
mom's got a stroller for for her kid you
put out these little legs and then look
you can attach it to your bike and then
look at that you connected look at that
that's freaking crazy the kid could go
biking as well that' actually be so fun
as a kid holy that's sick it's crazy
that that was like 100 years ago dang
what the frck maybe not 100 but the
whatever I don't know look at this ultra
realistic car simulator thingy
that can move it can twist you right the
only thing it needs to be able to do is
go upside down that would be crazy for
for when you crash you know that'd be
sick maybe a little dangerous but come
on I want realism here I want to do this
in GTA 5 and do like a try not to break
any laws or something that that'd be fun
leave a like if I should do that on my
gaming channel last but not least this
is a fart vacuum just slip it in your
pants and press the vacuum to quickly
suck up your fart so now you can fart
anywhere you want hide things and let's

Brave Wilderness,"21,200,000","5,057,708,258",997,Pets & Animals,2014,"- I'm Coyote Peterson.
Now you've seen me stung by harvester ants,
fire ants, and scorpions.
But today, I'm moving a rung up
on the insect sting pain index,
and I'm going to be stung by the cow killer.
I have a feeling that this one is going to hurt.
Oh boy.
(scream)
(intense percussion music)
There's no question about it.
The wild west is rough and rugged.
And whether you're talking about the rocky terrain,
laced with spine covered plants, or its animals,
most of which are armed with fangs and stingers,
Arizona's Sonoran Desert is an adventure lover's playground.
Sure we all have our fears of being bitten
by a rattlesnake when venturing off trail.
Or in my case, having a giant desert centipede
run on my pant leg.
But in actuality, the good news is that each
and every one of these creatures
does its best to avoid human interaction.
However, sometimes you have an accidental run-in.
And when you do, a bite or a sting
can be incredibly painful.
(gasping)
Yeah, he got me.
He bit me.
- [Mark] You sure?
- [Coyote] Yeah, he definitely bit me.
When it comes to my line of work,
the goal is to have an interaction,
so that I can show you the effects of these encounters.
This way we can all learn why it's important
to be in tune with our surroundings,
and why it's always best to admire animals
from a safe distance.
Velvet ant, velvet ant!
(mumbling)
I can pick off, yes, hold on,
he's underneath the log, I just started
to tip and so I ran back, hold on a second.
- [Mark] I saw him.
- [Coyote] Did you see it?
- [Mark] He ducked out and ducked back in.
- [Coyote] There it is, there it is.
- [Mark] Get him, get him to go in it.
- Aagh!
Yes, yes!
Look at that.
Whoo!
Oh, you almost got me with the crevice of that log.
Wow, that is a good sized one too.
Ah, but we got our velvet ant.
There it is.
Okay, cool, well, tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna get stung.
By that little ornery bugger.
Cool.
The velvet ant, which is actually a species of ground wasp,
and not an ant at all, claims a famous nickname.
The cow killer.
Ranked on the insect sting pain index
as being the fourth most painful sting
in the insect kingdom, rumor has it
that the pain is so intense it can kill a cow.
You may be looking at this, thinking to yourself
""Coyote, are you gonna get stung?""
Yeah, I am, I'm gonna get stung by this today.
Now the insect sting pain index says
that the intense pain will last for about 30 minutes.
And the reason that I'm doing it is
to work my way up to the bullet ant.
You wanna see me stung by the bullet ant?
Kind of feel like I have to get stung by everything else
leading up to that.
I am not looking forward to 30 minutes of pain
that's gonna come from this insect.
I know, right?
Here we go again.
Coyote is about to enter the strike zone.
But this one's a little different.
When it comes to alligator bites,
crab pinches, or blood sucking leeches,
I'm fine with that.
When it comes to stingers and venom,
that's where even I get nervous.
Now, the females do not have wings.
The males do have wings, but what's interesting
is that the males do not have stingers.
Guess who does have a stinger?
That's right, the females.
And that's what we have here today.
Now one of the most impressive things
about this insect is the size of its stinger.
In fact, it's about as long as the entire
length of the abdomen.
What I want to do now is use these little
entomology forceps to pick the velvet ant up,
and show you guys just how big that stinger is.
You ready for this?
- [Mark] Are they delicate?
- Um, they are not.
The velvet ant actually has a very,
very durable exoskeleton, one of the toughest
exoskeletons in the insect kingdom.
So me picking her up with the forceps
is not going to cause her any sort of pain or danger.
Oh!
- [Mark] Oh, getting away, getting away.
- [Coyote] I got it, I got it.
- [Mark] You got it?
- [Coyote] Got it.
- [Mark] Got it, awesome.
- Now they can be found in the grass,
so if you're out there walking around barefoot,
and you step on one of these, you're not gonna squish it.
What's gonna happen is it's gonna spin around,
and then it's gonna tuck its abdomen under
and boom, you're gonna get nailed with that giant stinger.
Well, I think at this juncture,
it is time for me to actually take a sting.
Are you guys getting nervous?
I'll tell you what, I sure was.
Now they say that this sting is painful enough
to kill a cow.
However, there are no reported cases of cows,
or humans for that matter, ever dying
from a velvet ant sting.
This makes me feel a bit better,
but you never know how your body will react to venom,
so we always have an Epidendrum pen on location,
just in case I have an allergic reaction to the sting.
All right, Mark's signaling me
that it is time, here we go.
I am about to be stung by the velvet ant.
Hoo, here we go.
Hoo.
- [Mark] All right Coyote, well, it's about that time.
- Yeah.
- [Mark] How are we gonna pull this off?
I see we have a, you know, camera wise
we have a GoPro, a small camera right next to me,
oh hey, there's Chance.
Chance over there.
What's the gameplan for the sting in here?
What's the idea?
- Well, this is gonna go down one of two ways.
What I'm gonna try first is to actually
take this little glass, flip it upside down,
get the ant to this end, and then place it down
on top of my arm.
This will isolate the ant on my skin,
and I'm hoping that as it tries to get away,
it's just going to sting me.
Now if that doesn't work, I also have my pair
of entomology forceps, and I'm actually
going to pick, hold the ant, place it on my arm,
and let it sting me.
One way or another, I am definitely going to be stung
by the velvet ant.
Haaah, here we go.
Okay, now the first thing I'm gonna do
is get the ant up into that part of the glass,
and then I'm going to spin this over
onto my forearm and with any luck,
the ant is going to sting me.
Here we go, ready?
- [Mark] Let's do it, here comes number four.
- I'm Coyote Peterson, and I'm about
to enter the sting zone with the velvet ant.
One, two, here we go, three.
Oh boy.
Oh, my heart's racing right now.
Aah boy, I can see its abdomen kind of pumping.
My heart is going now.
- [Mark] Any second it could happen.
- Yeah, any second it could sting me.
Oh boy, ooh ooh ooh, ow ow ow,
ow, it's biting at my skin,
it's biting at the edge of the container trying to get out.
Ooh.
Oh, and that stinger is gonna be
like a little hypodermic needle going into my skin.
This is intense.
The glass is actually starting to get a little foggy
from the heat of my skin, so at this point
I think we are going to move to plan B,
which is holding the velvet ant
with the entomology forceps.
I don't think it's going to sting me at this point.
It's been in there for about two minutes,
and so far no sting.
It's just trying to get out.
So I'm gonna flip my arm upside down,
and get the ant back under control.
Okay, here we go, ready?
- [Mark] Okay.
- One, two, three.
Okay, whoo.
Ahhhh.
- [Mark] How do you feel?
- Aahh, extremely nervous, and my heart is racing.
I actually think I do have to take a second
just to get my heart rate to calm back down.
Okay, cut and GoPro.
Okay.
All right, the only way to actually
move forward with this is for me to hold the ant
with the entomology forceps.
Up against my skin, and let it sting me.
- [Mark] This seems, this gonna do it, isn't it?
- Yeah, hold on, I need a second, heart's like,
- [Mark] You all right?
- Ooh, getting dizzy, yeah, getting dizzy.
In the world of entomology, when it comes
to milking the venom of insects and arachnids,
holding them with forceps is a guaranteed way
to induce a sting.
So I think we all know what's going to happen next.
This is crazy, guys, this is crazy.
My nerves are going this much for the velvet ant,
I can't imagine what the tarantula hawk
and the bullet ant are gonna be like.
Okay.
- [Mark] I can't believe you're about to do this.
That stinger is enormous.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, you can do this, you can do this.
- [Mark] So is that stinger
gonna go all the way under you skin?
- Yeah, it's gonna go right into my skin.
- [Mark] Okay, I'm ready.
Oh boy.
All right, here we go.
- Here we go, ready?
All right, let's do this again
one more time for good measure.
I'm Coyote Peterson, and I'm about to enter
the sting zone with the cow killer.
Are you ready?
- [Mark] Are you ready?
- No, I'm never ready.
One, two, three.
You good?
- [Mark] Yeah.
- Get your shot, I'm gonna place it
right down on my arm.
Here we go.
With my arm shaking.
And go.
Ahh!
(pained gasps)
Okay, I'm gonna get back here.
- [Mark] You all right?
What are you feeling?
- Gaah!
Oh, wow.
Oh wow, okay.
(heavy breathing)
Give me a second.
Oh my gosh.
- [Mark] You all right?
- Oh yeah.
- [Mark] What are you feeling, what does it feel like?
- Give me a sec, give me a sec.
(rapid panting)
Oh my gosh guys, this is super bad.
Move this out of the way.
Gah!
Gah!
Oh my gosh, I gotta try to control my heart rate.
Try to get a tight shot of it right there
with the stinger, we need to see to see if there's blood.
Okay, try to get a shot, because if I can get it
we'll like walk around for a second.
Right there.
- [Mark] Right there is where it stung you?
- Right where it stung me.
I could feel it, it was like,
you could feel it go all the way under the skin.
All the way in.
I can feel it insert into my arm.
(grunting)
- [Mark] You gonna be all right?
- Okay.
Now they say that the sting of the velvet ant,
will last for about 30 minutes.
And I can tell you guys right now,
this is the worst sting I've ever taken.
There's no question about it.
It is worse than a harvester ant,
it is worse than a fire ant.
It feels like I'm getting stung over and over again.
You can see the welts starting to form on my arm.
- [Mark] Oh man, yeah, those are welts, big time.
Describe the pain, is it like a pulsating pain,
a stabbing pain?
- If it pain, it's radiating, it is radiating.
It feels like, you know if you get a charlie horse
in your muscle, and it like seizes up,
and it's like doomph, doomph.
Ah, that is powerful.
Ah, I can see why they call them cow killers.
(chuckle)
That is some intense pain right there.
How long has it been?
- [Mark] About seven minutes.
- About seven minutes?
Well they say the pain from this lasts for about 30.
I have about 23 minutes to go, guys.
23 minutes to go.
Aah!
Now aside from working my way up to the bullet ant,
the reason I was willing to take a sting
from this insect was so that we could
all see the effects of the venom.
25 minutes has gone by.
My arm is still on fire.
And what's crazy is that, look at all the red blotching
that's formed around the sting.
There is the stinger insertion point right there,
and it is swollen, and it is very tender,
and you can see how red the entire radius is,
of the sting.
I'm sweating.
My goal was to do the best I could
to describe the pain I was feeling.
And it still hurts, it definitely still hurts,
but not as bad as the initial impact of the stinger.
But what's interesting is that all around the sting
is tingling, like these little tiny pin cushion needles
going tsk tsk tsk.
And as you can see there's all these little red dots
forming, and I'm assuming that is where the venom
is spreading into my arm.
Oh wow, well I would say that this was definitely
one very intense sting.
The cow killer has earned its reputation
as being one of the most powerful stings
in the insect kingdom
Gaaggh!
Arrrgghh!
Ergh!
And while it may be ranked as a four
on the insect sting pain index,
for me, at this point, it's definitely number one.
I'd say I'm one step closer
to being stung by the bullet ant,
but first, I'm gonna have to go up against
the tarantula hawk.
I have a feeling that that one is going to be bad.
I'm Coyote Peterson.
Be brave, stay wild, we'll see you on the next adventure.
Whoo, let's get out of the desert.
Velvet ants are nomadic ground dwellers,
that feed primarily on nectar.
So there is absolutely no reason
you should ever fear them.
If you live or are hiking in velvet ant territory,
you'll want to avoid a possible sting.
Keep your boots on your feet, and you will be just fine.
If you thought that sting was intense,
make sure to check out the compilation
of all my worst bites, pinches, and stings,
as we work our way up to the bullet ant challenge.

but the challenge is you can't smile or laugh while watching.
Why not?
(Finebros) That's the whole point; it's a challenge.
You laugh or smile, you lose. Here we go.
Okay.
So I'm not... I can't... I can't laugh?
(Finebros) Or smile.
Or smile?
(takes a breath) Now I'm smiling already.
I'm gonna go to my dark place.
(cracking jawbone)
Warming up the jaw.
(Finebros) All right. Here we go!
(bleep)
? (men vocalizing ""The Blue Danube"") ?
God, it's so perfect.
Gotta take a deep breath.
This is really difficult... to not laugh at this.
Is it gonna be five minutes of this guy... air humping?
I've seen this too many times to be funny.
Nothing funny about that.
I've cracked it. I've got the technique down.
It's not getting me.
(arguing in foreign language)
(laughs)
Bro, come on, come on, dawg.
(laughs)
I think I'm gonna win this challenge.
(laughs)
You can't... That is insane.
(laughs)
(Finebros) So close. After it ended?
I don't know. I can't hold it.
Look. I haven't laughed yet.
(video) Come on, let me see your face!
Oh, is it PewDiePie?
You're gonna ask me to not laugh at PewDiePie?
(man in video laughing)
How do you not smile at that, bro?
It's a goat, it's a goat flying away...
(laughing in video continues)
Poor goat, he didn't deserve that.
It's always exceptionally hard not to laugh when somebody
else is laughing, but even worse when it's PewDiePie.
I think, I think I'm technically smiling right now. (laughs)
(Finebros) Also, not PewDiePie.
It's not PewDiePie?
(Finebros) But it's someone else who's Swedish.
What game is this?
What's making me wanna smile
is you guys holding in your laughter.
If I just maybe do this?
(video) Laddergoat, you're so random.
I think I've heard that phrase before...
""Laddergoat, you're so random.""
(breaths out) Okay...That was a close one.
- (baby chuckling) - Oh no... Oh no...
Ugh, no!
(man in video chuckling)
(man laughing oddly)
I'm in hell right now.
- (man laughing boisterously) - Okay.
(laughs)
Okay. I think that's a smile right there.
How did this one get me, though?
- (woman chortling and snorting) - What? What is that?
(woman honking and chortling)
(Finebros) You did it!
Not funny!
I have no soul.
I didn't laugh a single time!
(Finebros) You were close a couple of times.
I know, I almost puked.
(Finebros) Did you find those videos funny?
Yeah, they were funny.
I actually did.
Hilarious. Hilarious.
What was that guy trying to do...? On the wall...?
Like how could that possibly have ended well?
In the first one, I trained myself not to laugh.
Which one was the first one?
Oh, yeah, yeah... That's old school.
I thought when I saw that one, I was like,
""You guys, you're not gonna have us..."" But you got us.
I don't know why it was funny to anybody.
Did anybody laugh at that?
(Finebros) What do you think of the ladder goat?
Dude, I just like goats, man. That's not fair.
You expect video games to obey the laws of physics,
but when they don't, it's amusing.
I wish things were that funny to me, like,
if everything was that funny, life would be like a great place.
I wanna find out what game that is, just to find that goat,
so I can make it climb the ladder.
They didn't seem all that funny.
I guess it's interesting, because that's the same sort of area
as my videos.
A lot of people thought, like, when I was starting, and didn't
have my facecam... People were like, ""Are you Laddergoat?""
Yeah, he's like a Swedish gamer.
I actually made a video with him.
Can you imitate one of the laughs you heard
from the laughter chain video?
I almost lost it with that dude, he was like...
(imitates laughter)
Hya-hya-hya-hya.
(raspy chuckling)
(throaty laughing)
(high-pitched giggling)
Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka... (laughs)
(Finebros) Why is watching other people laugh
something that makes people laugh?
I don't know. Science maybe?
People that, like, have a very specific laugh make you laugh.
You just see people laughing, and then you're like,
""I wanna be laughing and having fun too!""
It's like when someone yawns, you yawn all the time.
Yeah, laughing is contagious. Why is laughing contagious?
There we go. See? We just case in point right here.
Someone's, like, crying or my friends start crying,
and they call me like... (imitates crying)
I'm just like, ""I know, girl. I know. He's bad for you.""
(Finebros) What is the technique you try
to make yourself not laugh?
Well, I failed pretty bad, so I guess I didn't have one.
Try to distract myself.
Just trying to, like hyperanalyze things
and think about them in a complicated way.
By being myself. I have no sense of humor.
I found trying to shove a fist in the mouth.
Yeah, you were doing that. You were really going for that.
I was sucking in my cheeks like that.
Like, I tell myself, ""This is not funny.
You are not going to laugh.""
So, it's almost like mind over body.
I try to think of the most awful thing in the world.
It's like working at a theme park for ten years
- or for life. - (Finebros laugh)
Like, think of something else. I was like, ""Puppies. Rainbows.
- Biscuits. Gravy."" - (Finebros) What about dead puppies?
Oh, oh. Too far.
- Oh, now I'm sad. - (Finebros) But that would help.
Why has the idea of ""I bet you can watch without laughing""
- become an online thing? - Well, 'cause we want to laugh.
And we want to be made to laugh.
Watching isn't enough anymore. Let's make a challenge out of it.
Let's make a game out of watching.
I mean, anything with the ""try not to laugh"" tied to it
is probably gonna be something uplifting.
Why would you not want to watch something like that?
And then there are going to be the people like me
who take a challenge very literally and say,
""I'm not laughing at this. No way.""
Like, that's something that everybody would click on,
'cause they're like, ""Yeah, I can (bleeping) not laugh at that.""
And then they feel like me who don't,
and then you pat yourself on the back.
(Finebros) Does it feel good to succeed?
It feels, actually, really sad,
'cause you guys are asking me questions like,
""Why didn't you laugh?"" and then I'm like, ""I don't know,""
and then I think about it in my head.
I'm like, ""Why am I not laughing? Am I sad inside?
Am I just not having a good day?""
(Finebros) Is there a video out there
that just makes you laugh every time you see it?
- ""Go! Bwaaah!"" - ""Go! Bwaaah!""
- ""Washington."" - ""Single Ladies Clown Dance.""
""Pretty much everywhere, it's gonna be hot.""
This dude getting frisked by a cop,
and his pants are, like, sagging really low,
and then the cop reaches around and he's like, ""What's this?""
And he's like, ""That's my penis.""
He's like, ""Oh, your penis. All right, sorry."" (laughing)
It's so funny!
(Finebros) And finally, the most important question of all:
- why do we laugh, anyway? - Stress relief.
'Cause we're uncomfortable.
(forced laugh)
(turns to weeping)
Oh, (bleep), that's deep. That's really deep.
Why do we laugh? Why do we cry?
Why do we bleed? Hmm?
I don't know, basically, is what I'm trying to say.
You guys, this is a deep question.
Write in the comments below. Why do we laugh?
Let's get the audience involved in this.
I think about that sometimes, believe it or not.
Like, when I'm laying in bed at night staring up at my ceiling,
I can't fall asleep. I'm just like...
(whispers) Laughing, like...
It's laughing and ""I'm gonna die.
No matter what I do, I'm gonna die.""
It's obviously a natural response, because even babies do it,
and we haven't taught them,
""Hey, this is what you do when something is funny.""
I don't know and it's awesome.
I think laughter is one of those
things about people that makes us great.
Famine, starvation, terrible rape, terrible things--
all over the place,
but the fact that laughter is something
that we start doing at, like, 24 hours old--
it's nice.

The question is, what video makes you laugh the most?
Let us know in the comments below.
Question is, why do you have bare feet? That's the question.
- I'm airing them out. - I don't think it's appropriate.
We're on set, you've got your bare feet out.
Sometimes you gotta get loose.
I would appreciate it if you put your shoes back on.

survive and sadly these two villages in
cameroon don't have reliable access to
it so we partnered with the charity to
dig two wells and i sent darren and the
team over to help we are building two
separate wells that will each produce 10
000 liters of water per day our first
well will go down 180 feet and our
second well will go down 270. these
depths will give our whales plenty of
access to clean drinking water these
wells are gonna serve between nine and
twelve thousand people which means that
each person is going to get at least two
liters of clean drinking water a day
when we arrived we immediately started
working with the team to get the first
well built this is the stream that they
got to come and get water from every day
you can see
how polluted it is and it's also filled
with a whole load of parasites there are
some days that they have so little water
to drink that they have to drink this
unfiltered river water and oftentimes
land up in the hospital there are a lot
of problems if you don't have good
drinking water at times you have rolling
stomach many people in fumble do suffer
from typhoid we just spend one year one
week without water in the whole town
both of these wells will literally save
lives but there's so much more to get
done while the first one has some
challenges the second one is even harder
being almost two times as deep to get
the same amount of water but we're gonna
do whatever it takes to help the people
of cameroon without these wells and
access to clean water oftentimes these
kids have to skip school for students
don't attend to classes and some escape
from classes because of lack of good
drinking water we sometimes we carry
water from our houses right at school
having our backs making it difficult for
us to be in the school campus these kids
are amazing they're so happy and playful
and excited and it was really something
special and it was very heartwarming
realizing the impact that we were having
over there pause before we can continue
the video we have a sponsorship i want
to tell you about and the reason we have
the sponsor on this video is i want to
take the money they give us and build
more wells in the same place in the
future because i know you think we have
unlimited money but we don't actually
and this will allow us to help tens of
thousands of people and having said that
dragon city is a free-to-play mobile
game available on ios and android
basically you can collect thousands of
dragons and build your own empire and
this month they're celebrating their
10th anniversary and the coolest part is
they're bringing back all four mr beast
dragons for it the mr beast dragon the
beast gamer dragon the beast mode dragon
the super beast dragon they're all
coming back why isn't there a darren
dragon no one's ever asked for one you
can even have your dragons make babies
and train them to be stronger it's easy
to get hooked on this game and i've
already spent hours playing it and if
you'd like to support beast philanthropy
and help us build more wells in the
future click the link in description and
download the game you can also download
dragon city right now by scanning the qr
code in jimmy's face it's actually on
your face you don't have putting images
on people's faces privileges you'll get
in-game rewards like 30 000 gold 10 gems
15 000 food if you download the game in
the next seven days you get a free game
we get to build more wells it's a
win-win click the link down in the
description and thank you dragon city
for helping us build more wells water
isn't just important for survival but
it's also necessary to stay clean and
healthy during the craving time to
hardly wash our hands and ski because we
had no good drinking water that is
absurd could you imagine not washing
your hands during a pandemic because you
don't have water well fortunately after
all the team's hard work and all the
anticipation from the community we
finally struck water and the community
could not have been more excited
[Applause]
when we arrived we were greeted with
celebrations from the people of cameroon
the reception that we got was something
that i'd never in my entire life imagine
there's hundreds of people around maybe
even thousands this was nothing that we
had expected they put in plays they
danced they gave speeches it was
incredible this was such a big deal for
the people over there that the president
of cameroon sent these pieces of
clothing to show his appreciation but
for me it just reinforced how serious
our job in cameroon is having access to
clean drinking water is something that
we take for granted we don't even think
about it and yet over there it's very
common for the people to say water is
life
water is everything based on the data
i've been given these two wells will
produce 7.5 million liters of water per
a year it almost seems unfathomable this
channel isn't just me and darren it's
all of us by watching this video you
literally helped us pay for more wells
in the future we also have two that went
well shirts for sale on
shopbeastphilanthropy.com all of the
revenue we earn from these shirts will
help fund more wells in the future based
on our math each t-shirt we sell will
provide 2 000 clean liters of drinking
water per year that is absurd and on top
of that you just get this cool looking
shirt and if you continue to watch this
channel just imagine how many more
people we can help in the future"

but i've been packaging i'm really good
i
promise well
we do need another player
i'd rather play two on three come on you
can take them
oh
this sucks kyle why didn't you put me
in you know i've been practicing you see
me what's he talking about
do you know him or something no i have
no idea who he is
but i'm a nobody you're just an autistic
kid
who'll never be able to do the things
that's normal kids can't
so why don't you just get out of here
special needs sam
kyle how could you say that to sam
i was just joking in my classroom
now
[Music]
yes we are waiting for you in room 101
great
your mother is here
hi hi i'm so sorry please
kyle what did you do this time
nothing well he called samuel here
special needs sam
at recess and then wouldn't let him play
with them
how could you do that
to your own brother brother
i'm so disappointed in you what
it's not my fault he is autistic and has
a disability
is that what this is about honey
autism is not a disability it's just
a different ability okay
sam is not any less capable
than you or i what are you talking about
of course he is oh you'll see
starting today i want you to include him
in every activity no way
that's so unfair oh well it's either
that
or be grounded for a month
so what's it going to be
fine kyle
sinks in his chair so upset that he now
has to include sam
in everything the next day
kyle is playing chess again during
recess and doesn't know what move to
make
when sam offers his advice again kyle
hesitates
but remembering the words of his mom he
takes sam's advice
and ends up winning the game
and then in class another math
competition takes place
except this time kyle chooses sam
to go answer the last problem
sure enough sam ends up getting it right
and wins it for his team
kyle starts to see how capable sam
really is
and then as if kyle needed any more
confirmation
came the basketball match yes
next point wins come on guys
settle up
we can't lose again like yesterday i
can't play
my ankle's still not 100 sorry
what are we gonna do now
i've got an idea hey sam
want to play with us really yes
keep them covered
[Music]
you made it you did it
you know mama's right autism isn't a
disability
it's just a different ability who didn't
be better than all of us

tutorial on how to trick people into
thinking you're really good lucky if you
were born really ugly like me have no
fear there's steps you can take to be
good looking kind of I've already taken
some steps before we even start I bleach
the absolute [ __ ] out of my hair and I
tan my skin because if I did it would
look like an albino if you don't want to
tan your skin you can use fake
self-tanner
that way you can ruin all of your
clothes and when it washes off you can
look like you have been alive if you're
blind as a [ __ ] bet like me make sure
you get contact lenses glasses are for
douchebags I also have a retainer now
that you've got all that down it's time
to start getting ready step 1 take a
shower because you're probably dirty oh
that probably took a while cuz you're
one ugly mother now it's time to do make
literally take a bunch of makeup on your
face meat out now it's time to do your
eye makeup I like to use colors like
black because it says I'm a [ __ ] the
goal is to make yourself look nothing
like yourself perfect if you're thinking
about going with a more natural look
let's be serious
you're way too ugly to pull that off now
it's time to put on some fake [ __ ]
lashes and drawings and cartoon eyebrows
super duper don't forget your Gucci
lipstick I like this one because it
makes me look like a streetwalker now
it's time to infuse your hair that was
not good for it now remember since you
were born ugly you're probably pretty
weird that means God forbid you ever go
in public you're probably going to
embarrass
don't do any of this or this especially
not this Emily a little bit of this the
next step is go out and get yourself a
job that's super degrading
I picked dancing in my underwear before
I go to work I like to pump myself up by
crying over my master's degree now
remember there's no cure for ugly but
you can make yourself into a human
optical engine I like to leave all my
old facebook pictures on Facebook so
that everyone can know that I really am
an ugly [ __ ] so there you have
it
tricking people and just thinking that
you're good-looking when you're really
just a [ __ ] weirdo I realized that
this video is not helpful to men you're
just gonna have to find a girl that
thinks you're funny"

The sun’s shining in a beautiful way
gonna take a shower, brush my teeth and
Life is ultimately meaningless
....Uhh (cough)...

but I'll get out of the house
Get on the road, top down, hands out
Put on my favorite song and nod to the rhythm
The planet’s being destroyed by your carbon emissions

But I- I- , I’ll head to class
try my best on every test til I pass
and my grades are screaming in my face - Ayyyy
98 percent of what you learn is a waste. 

I get to hang out with all my friends
My friends are the friendliest friends
Can't think of a better way to spend my time
Your brain is flawed and all your friends will die
Nevermind!

I’m alive in the greatest nation!
So proud of- the exploitation of natives
This graceful bird means freedom for all
Tell that to the slaves and bald eagles aren't bald

I can live in the moment, milk every second
at any time you could get clinical depression
But I'll just be happy, no matter what’s in store
it’s quite genetic and we have no cure 
uhh- at least

(CHORUS )
We are young 
not for long
Life is fun
It only goes downhill
We gotta make the most of it, Make the most of it 
or you'll regret it
We are young 
For now
Life is fun 
for some people
We gotta make the most of it, Make the most of it
Good luck

Woo! I got a brand new job today!
Doin stuff that'll help the economy
I'll save money and buy things at the store
Banks can crash and capitalism is flawed

And it’s all because of my hard work
And the thousand advantages you lucked into at birth
I put a lotta effort in my resume!
Good thing you don't have a black person’s name

I'm proud to be a functioning member of society
Finally, I can be the citizen I dream to be
part of the community, contribute with my tax
What could possibly stop me?
The shrinking middle class

I’ve at least got a nice stable job
Until it’s outsourced to china or replaced by a robot
OH GOD- Well then I could relax a bit
You'll be empty with nothing to distract from it

But man I'm a passionate graduate 
I can be different and I have a career paths to pick from
I could be a rapper or an animator if I'm lucky
Neither of those will make you happy, trust me

I'm able to choose what I pursue
You're a slave to people born richer than you
Then screw it, I'll keep going in 
then I'll party on the weekend and sing

Thanks to autotune 

(CHORUS )

Life is a wonder
You’ll never know the answer

Nature is a miracle
Natural disasters

It’s good to be alive
You could wake up with cancer

But I'm healthy
Healthy people still get cancer

I love this show
It’s the last episode

The sun is shining
It’s going to explode

Every species is beautiful and unique though
Children have malaria thanks to mosquitoes

I met a cute girl with a ponytail
Statistically that relationship is going to fail

I have a wonderful family, it’s like no other
You're not special and one day you'll bury your mother

No matter what I can find a home!
We. Will. All. Die. Alone.

There’s amazing potential in every human on earth
There’s no escaping the heat death of the universe

I don't have to live life based on negative parts
No matter how bad they are, they're just thoughts

Yeah that’s fair
wait really?
yeah that seems reasonable
wait-wait-wait-wait but you were just telling me
whatever man, I dunno, live your life how you want,
I'm not forcing you to do anything, I'm just saying.
Oh...Well in that case...

singer with the wealthiest parents in
town before i continue please like and
subscribe selling out concerts weekly
and dealing with fans around the world
might sound fun but you know what's even
cooler partying all night long in the
middle of my show i escaped with my
boyfriend theo to go to the biggest
island party ever but when he pulled
over to a helicopter pad my excitement
turned to panic i thought we were gonna
use a yacht you know i have a phobia of
heights right it's a five-minute ride
you're just being melodramatic get over
it get over it
enjoy the party without this drama queen
then babe come on i didn't mean it i'm
sorry i just ignored him and stormed off
as i walked back to the city i noticed a
person in a hooded jacket following me i
grabbed my stiletto and yelled at him
why are you hiding dude are you scared
don't worry i don't bite to my surprise
he just threw a magazine at me and ran
away what the chocolate fudge i picked
it up and realized that it was my
magazine with a death threat drawn all
over my face unfortunately for him i was
fearless the threats kept coming over
the weekend my parents had always wanted
to hire a bodyguard for me but i didn't
want some boring old guy to keep
following me around but this time they
wouldn't take no for an answer when i
finally saw my bodyguard i almost passed
out he was the most exquisite specimen
of a man i had ever seen and he looked
just a few years older than me hey
handsome are you sure you're a bodyguard
and not my next boyfriend to my surprise
he didn't smile a bit rude you look too
young for this job how can i trust you
suddenly a ball from our neighbor came
hurling right at me and he instantly
caught it with one hand trust me i'm
really good at my job you can check my
records your father has everything you
need yeah okay whatever let's go he
opened the car door for me and as i
slipped in i accidentally brushed my
shoulder on his chest and oh my it felt
harder than a rock when we arrived at
school theo didn't look so happy to see
me with my young bodyguard he pulled me
aside and said look babe i know i
insulted you the other night but getting
back at me by flirting with another guy
how could you he's my freaking bodyguard
i'm still mad at you for what you did
and now you're accusing me of cheating
suddenly damon stepped in is there a
problem here stay out of this man theo
tried to push him aside but damon
pounced on him and pinned him to the
ground what the heck are you doing let
go of me idiot hey stop it damon finally
released my boyfriend after a minute as
expected theo went psycho i immediately
blocked him before he got his butt
kicked by damon that's enough theo he's
just doing his job why do you need a
bodyguard when you have me i'm your
boyfriend i'll protect you a small
spider suddenly landed on his shoulder
and he ran screaming protect my butt as
i walked down the hall with damon girls
were literally drooling all over him he
looks more like a model than a bodyguard
he can be the father of my children he's
way more attractive than theo i really
want to feel his biceps these girls
sounded so desperate but they were right
when i reached our classroom my best
friend tessa came up to me with my
favorite coffee hey girl so i brought
you your damon suddenly snatched it and
started sniffing it he then took a sip
and waited for a few seconds before
saying clear as he gave it back to me
tessa was glaring at him excuse me did
you really think that i'll poison my
best friend just doing my job tessa then
dragged me to a corner so you're giving
up your privacy just like that i can see
that he's very attractive but something
about him screams bad news he even
sounds like a demon you have to get rid
of him asap oh come on girl it's just
his first day let's see but tessa was
right i didn't have a second of privacy
damon followed me around every freaking
second he stood behind me in all of my
classes and even in restrooms it was so
awkward at home he'd just stand outside
my door and i never saw him sleep and
worse he had this permanent ice-cold
expression on his face that gave me
chills i had a recording event one night
and when i reached the studio a guy came
rushing toward me he was about to draw
out something from his back pocket when
suddenly damon grabbed his arm and
twisted it drop your weapon
what i just wanted an autograph from her
man damon let go of the poor guy and it
was so embarrassing what's the matter
with you i'm a popular singer so you
have to get used to my fans just doing
my job calm down sasha calm down the
next day at school theo kept following
me around to apologize but i still
ignored him until he said my producer
cousin is throwing an exclusive yacht
party with some a-listers this weekend
she's a fan of yours and she'd be
ecstatic if you came he had my attention
now parties were my weakness
not so fast sweetheart hang out with me
tomorrow okay
fine theo requested not to bring damon
to our date tomorrow so i talked to him
in private my job is not to leave your
side for a minute so sorry can't do he
was so firm about this so i finally gave
up and let him come with us we went to a
private movie theater and watched a
super sad movie together minutes into
the movie theo and i were already crying
our hearts out while damon had no
reaction
at all what was he a robot after the
movie we went to a fancy restaurant and
i was having a good time with the
lobster until theo started forcing
himself on me just one kiss babe come on
not now theo we're in a public place and
people are staring but he was persistent
just then damon grabbed him and threw
him away like a piece of paper theo was
furious he grabbed a chair but before he
could hit damon with it i pushed him
away stop it right now your stupid
bodyguard started it why don't you tell
him to get a life and go home to his
mommy no theo you go home i immediately
called him a cab and when he was finally
gone i turned to damon angrily i know he
was being a jerk but i can handle my
personal life you don't have to
interfere every freaking second he was
disrespecting your personal space your
job is to keep me safe not to meddle in
my personal matters know your boundaries
apologies it will never happen again i
actually didn't mind that theo got the
thrashing he deserved but damon always
being around was just getting on my
nerves a few days later at a concert i
was performing my newest single and
everyone was singing along with me it
felt amazing some of them even started
climbing up on the stage to join me
suddenly damon jumped in and pushed them
off stage what in the world he then
lifted me and carried me to the
backstage in the middle of my freaking
performance i finally had enough my
parents are paying you to protect me not
to annoy me and screw up my concerts
your life is in danger ma'am you have to
treat everyone as an enemy that is
ridiculous whoever sends those stupid
threats is probably just some harmless
loser better to be safe than sorry i
complained to my parents about his
behavior but they praised him for it but
he's ruining my career and even my
personal life he's just doing his job
honey and that's to make sure you're
safe all the time they were hopeless
cases so i resorted to tessa instead and
she came up with a plan test his
patience annoy him do everything you can
to make him quit you're good at that you
gorgeous brat i love the sound of it
girl you're the best of course i am i
stayed up at 4am that night to disturb
damon in the sleep but to my surprise he
was already up i need you to get my
favorite starbucks coffee that's not
part of my job description do it or i'll
make your job harder fine what's your
order
one i spent caramel macchiato with six
shots of mocha one quarter not that milk
one eighth almond milk with medium
whipped cream and a caramel drizzle with
a rose design on top in a biodegradable
tickle cup with a pink straw got it
what i was just messing with him but to
my surprise he immediately left and holy
mother of toads he came back with my
exact order how anything else
that that's all for now later that day i
went to the mall and went on a crazy
shopping spree making him carry all my
bags to tire him out but he was like a
machine i entered a clothing store and
as i tried on all the prettiest clothes
i kept asking for his opinion but he
wasn't paying attention hello
aren't you gonna give me a compliment or
something giving an opinion about your
outfits is not part of my job ma'am any
normal guy would have been drooling at
me by now he must be a cyborg to get
back at him i faked a sprain and forced
him to carry me on his back but he was
still as strong as a freaking tank
finally giving up i went to the bathroom
with everything i'd bought and escaped
through the window after making sure
that i'd lost him i went to an orphanage
and gave out all the clothes to the kids
while i was having fun with them tessa
sent me some pictures of theo kissing a
blonde girl in a restaurant at this
point i didn't even care theo was trash
i immediately sent him a message and
told him that we were done he was the
worst boyfriend anyway he started
calling me immediately so i just blocked
him problem solved later i went to a
local club to celebrate my breakup and
while i was dancing my heart out i was
shocked to see someone watching me from
the bar damon of course he tracked me
down a cute guy tried to dance with me
and suddenly damon came and pushed him
away hey listen buddy i'm sick of this
if you're gonna keep scaring all the
other guys away you dance with me i
don't mix business with pleasure dance
with me or go sit quietly in a corner
while i find someone before i could poke
the guy next to me damon suddenly
grabbed my hand to dance just then the
song shifted to a slow romantic one and
he pulled me in closer by the waist it's
not so bad is it if you say so ma'am you
can say my name you know if you say so
sasha he had the faintest smile on his
face and my heart skipped a beat we slow
danced as he looked deep into my eyes
and suddenly his face was so close to
mine just then he pulled away from me
like he'd had an electric shock we we
need to go home but it's still early
safety reasons ugh he was so annoying
when we got home i saw a box sitting on
my bed and when i opened it lots of rats
jumped out and started running all over
the room damon saw a little note inside
and for the first time ever it scared me
for real someone broke into your room
this person means business we have to be
more careful ma'am he suggested that i
shouldn't go to school for the next few
days for safety and i agreed one night
my manager called and reminded me of my
concert in paris the next day it was my
biggest one yet and i had to go i don't
think you should be making public
appearances till we find out who's
trying to hurt you no i'm not gonna let
some creep scare me and make me decide
what i should do this was planned in
advance and all the tickets are sold and
i'm not canceling damon was forced to
allow me but on one condition we had to
share a hotel room so he could keep a
constant eye on me when we were finally
in paris i rehearsed my songs all night
while he was constantly looking out the
window the next morning i found him
still asleep on the couch when something
on the floor caught my attention a
picture of a beautiful girl in his
wallet she looked around my age i
quickly put the wallet away feeling
something weird was i jealous
no of course not why would i care if he
had a girlfriend hours before the
concert while my makeup team was working
on me damon suddenly snatched me away
can't you just postpone this it's too
dangerous i told you i can't please
sasha just listen to me i care about you
you know oh do you i thought i was your
only client just do your job which is to
keep me alive and let me do my job which
is to entertain people and actually i
prefer it when you call me ma'am you got
me loud and clear ma'am during my
concert i tried not to think of damon
and the death threats and it was going
so well in the middle of my performance
i saw damon in the crowd and he was
smiling at me he looked so lovely now
snap out of it sasha he has a girlfriend
while i was singing my fourth song i
suddenly spotted a hooded figure in the
crowd and he was aiming something at me
no no no i froze in panic but just then
a strong pair of arms grabbed me and
carried me off the stage and i looked up
to see damon's tense face stay here
don't move he returned a few minutes
later saying he'd lost the hooded figure
i was still shaking in fear and he
gently picked me up and we returned to
the hotel he tucked me into bed and sat
on a chair close by i closed my eyes and
tried to sleep feeling safe as he
watched over me sometime later i felt
him fixing my blanket and gently
caressing my cheek as he left why did he
do that and why was it giving me a heart
attack when i woke up the next morning i
peeked into the kitchen and smiled when
i saw him dancing while cooking our
breakfast it was the first time i saw
him looking so
human i felt shy when he turned to me i
didn't have any makeup on that's the
first time i've seen you without makeup
and you look even more beautiful than
usual is complimenting me part of your
job now maybe i knew it no one can ever
resist my charms not even my emotionless
bodyguard i wonder what your girlfriend
would say about this i assume you're
talking about the picture of the girl in
my wallet gosh was he actually awake
that time he revealed that it was his
sister and they grew up in the orphanage
together he lost her because he'd failed
to protect her and that's why he became
a bodyguard she'd always wanted to go to
paris and go up the eiffel tower i
suddenly felt brave let's go there then
for her after what happened yesterday
there's no way i'm allowing you to go
anywhere also i know from your file that
you're afraid of heights i'm not scared
when i have you around i'll be fine i
promise he finally agreed but later as
we were climbing onto the escalator at
the eiffel tower he must have noticed i
was nervous are you sure about this we
can just go back you know no i can do
this when we reach the top i squealed
and covered my eyes you made it to the
top you have to see this view now i i
don't know if i can how about you take a
look and we'll go down but i don't want
you to miss this sasha i've got you do
you trust me
yes yes i do okay then open your eyes
when i say so i kept my eyes shut as he
led me forward and then suddenly i felt
his arms wrap around my waist now i
opened my eyes and i gasped i was so
close to the edge and the whole
glittering city was in front of me and
i'd never felt safer in my life damon
yes have you ever fallen for a client my
smile instantly faded at his answer no
it would never happen i can't do my job
well if i'm emotionally involved so it
was just me he was feeling this he was
just being nice to his client after a
week i had to go back to school for the
final exams i looked for tessa so we
could study together in the library but
i couldn't find her i sat down to study
alone and let damon stand by the door so
i could focus minutes later he barged in
and yelled sasha look out to my horror
the huge bookshelf behind me began to
fall on me but damon left forward and
pushed me out of harm's way and it fell
on him he was in the hospital for a week
and despite my parents protests that i
needed to stay safe at home i insisted
on visiting him every day one day while
i was in the waiting area tessa came to
see me with my favorite coffee but
before i could take a sip a hand
suddenly slapped the cup away we turned
to see damon and a cop beside him who
suddenly put handcuffs on tessa what are
you doing you damon
what's happening suddenly he revealed
something that blew my mind tessa was
the one who'd pushed the bookshelf on me
i'd been keeping an eye on her and
studying her that day i saw her enter
the library from the back door and i
knew she was up to no good i'm sure your
coffee is poison too my best friend was
trying to hurt me tessa why and suddenly
tessa turned into a monster because i
hate you you have everything i've ever
wanted beauty talent fame wealth theo
life is so unfair it would have gotten
rid of you already if your stupid
bodyguard wasn't such a pain she
screamed as the cop dragged her away and
i was left speechless damon then pulled
me into a hug are you okay i'll be fine
how are you i'm okay but i can't be your
bodyguard anymore sasha i just can't
fight my feelings for you anymore and
it's wrong if i fire you right now will
you be my boyfriend instead without a
word he grabbed my face and finally
kissed me on the lips i took that as a
yes"

- Good Mythical Morning. - As a kid, I was absolutely...
- ...obsessed with game shows. - Yes.
The great thing about them is that you get to put yourself in the place of the
contestant and say, ""Ooh! Would I get these right? Would I get these wrong?
Would I win the big bucks? What would I be willing to do to go all the way...
- ...to the cash top?"" - ""To the cash top"" is what they call it.
- ""To the cash crop."" - That's the official name.
Well, lots of people have been willing to go to great lengths to get to the cash...
- ...top, and maybe even too far. - Mm!
- That's what we're talking about today! - Yes, I wanna take you to 2001.
- Take me there. - The British version of ""Who Wants to...
...Be a Millionaire?"" in particular Charles Ingram. He was a former
major in the British Army, and then he was a contestant in the hot seat
on Millionaire. Now, he answered the first seven questions right...
- Hm, good. - ...amassing £4,000, but he already...
...used two lifelines in the process to get to this point.
- Ooh, yeah. Not good. - So, you know, not quite halfway there.
Not lookin' good. But he was rescued by the end of that episode.
Major Fraud
'Cause they said, ""Okay, come back tomorrow, audience, and see...
- Right. Cliffhanger. - ...how Charles the Major does.""
- So he had some time to regroup. - Yeah.
And he did some strategizing, and he came back the next day with a new
plan to go all the way to the top. Hopefully! So this is what I wanna do.
I wanna play a montage of his final answers for you and you and see if...
- ...you can identify his strategy, okay? - Mmkay.
I would've thought that it would be Aristotle Onassis.
- (someone coughs) - Yeah. I'm gonna go for...
- ...Aristotle Onassis. A1 or Craig David. - (coughs)
- No, I'll go Craig David. - (Rhett) Okay.
- (Link laughing) - If I had to guess...
- Has something to do with that woman. - ...take Cricket.
- (someone coughs) - I'm going to play Googol.
- Yeah. Final answer. - (announcer) Final answer?
(Link) This is it, here. This is the last one.
- (announcer) You just won 1,000,000! - (crowd cheering)
- (Link) Yes! What a surprise! - (announcer) 1,000,000!
- (Link) Listen to what the host says. - (announcer) You are the most...
...amazing contestant we have ever, ever had!
- Yeah, you sure are. - ""You are the most amazing contestant...
- ...we have ever, ever had!"" - You and that woman you brought...
- ...with you. (coughing) - (laughing) So, he was amazing...
...because he was cheating. Can you guess how, Rhett?
- The coughing. That's my guess. - This episode never aired.
- Mm. - But this footage was used in...
...a documentary, which I highly recommend, look it up. It's called
""Major Fraud,"" which documents this whole thing, and that's why the mix was altered
for the coughs to be so loud. But yes, he came back on day two and orchestrated
a whole plan, where that woman who was coughing and covering her face was...
- ...his wife. And then he also got the... - Oh!.
...help of a contestant who was waiting in the wings named Tecwen.
- (Rhett exhales) - And the two of them would cough...
whenever he would say the answer they thought was correct.
- That's effective. And he would read all of the answers and...
- ...then wait for the cough. - I heard the cough.
Yeah. Everyone started to hear it over the course of the game, except for the
host, who was so dialed in that he never noticed and kept things going.
- People cough. It happens. - (Link) Here's a picture of Tecwen.
(Link in a nasally voice) ""Hello, I'm Tecwen. I'm willing to cheat for...
- ...someone else."" - (Rhett laughing) I wonder what his...
...agreement was: how much he was gonna get.
I don't know, but at one point, Charles forgot his system, and instead of
reading every answer, so that he could cough at the correct one, he just said,
""I think it's so-and-so."" And then Tecwen was like (through a cough) ""No!""
- (laughing) - He literally coughed, ""No!""
- You can hear it, audibly. - Sometimes you have to do that...
- ...kinda thing. - So the producers obviously caught on...
Phone Call
...to this, and then they gave him a phone call a few days later, and they recorded...
- ...the phone call. Let's listen to that. - (producer) I have to tell you that we...
- ...have suspicions from viewing the... - Oh, really.
...recording of last Monday's, uh, program. I've subsequently studied the...
...tapes carefully. There were irregularities during the taping of the...
- ...show in which you participated. - Specifically coughing.
- (Charles) Oh, good Lord, no. - (producer) Because of that...
...I have to tell you that these suspicions have been referred to the...
- ...police. And thus... - (Charles) Right.
- The po-po? - ...we will not for the moment be...
...airing the program or indeed authorizing payment of the check.
(Charles) Right. Yeah, well, I mean, you know, I completely refute...
- ...that, obviously. - (Rhett) Of course.
(Charles) Good Lord, [inaudible]. All right, well, thanks for...
- ...letting me know. Cheers. Bye. - (producer) Okay, thank you.
- ""Cheers. Bye."" (laughing) - ""Okay, thanks for letting me know.
- Uh, you caught me cheating. That's fine."" - Sounds a little guilty to me.
- (laughing) Yeah. - That's now how I would have denied...
- ...if I wasn't doing it. - Ya think? Just get off the phone as...
...quickly as you can. He was found guilty and fined £115,000.
-Whoa. - And he is now known around town...
- ...as the ""Coughing Major."" - Oh. That name sticks with you.
But Tecwen testified that his coughing was a combination of hay fever and...
- ...a dust allergy, And I believe it. - (through coughing) No, it wasn't.
- (laughing) - (through coughing) No, it wasn't!
- So top that one. - Okay, you remember this show...
Press Your Luck
- ...Press Your Luck, from the '80s. - I love this show.
You would play a game where you answer questions, and you would win spins
that you would get to take on the big board. And when you got to the big board,
you could win more spins and money, or if you hit a whammy, you would...
- ...lose everything. So here's how the... - Yes.
...game worked once you got to the big board, just so you understand.
- Go for it! Go for it! - (male voice offscreen) Here he goes!
Come on, big [bucks]. I need a 5000 and a spin for [Toby].
- Come on. Stop! - (Link) He got it.
- (crowd cheering) - (Rhett) Look at that.
- (Link) He got the 5000 and the spin. - Come on again for Tommy. Stop!
- (Link) Ooh! He got a whammy for Tommy. - (Rhett) Whoa. Look how...
...unhappy he is. Oh, thumbs down. (descending tone)
""I tried to do it for Tommy!"" Who's Tommy?
- Very, very dramatic. - Is that his name?
Probably not. That's how the game is played.
- Mhm. - But there's a guy named Michael...
...Larson who was an ice cream truck driver from Ohio.
- Okay. - He played the game a little bit...
...differently. Let's watch Michael play the big board.
- (Link) He looks like an ice cream... - (Rhett) Okay. 4000 and a spin.
(Rhett) Yep. 5000 and a spin.
- (Rhett) 1000 and a spin. - (Link) Yeah!
(Link stammering) Yeah!
- (Link) Whoa! (clapping) - (Rhett laughing) He's so happy!
- (Rhett) Keep going! Do it! Do it! - (Link) Yeah.
(Link) Press your luck!
(Link) Stop! Stop!
(Link) Go! go! Go!
(Link) Gah! (laughing)
(Rhett) Can you believe it?
- (Link) I can tell you right now... - (Rhett) $110,000!
(Link) I did not see this episode, because I would remember it.
(Link) And I would act like that if I were him, too.
- Look at that. - Celebration dance!
- Okay. - No whammies, no whammies, STOP!
- Link, what did you think was going... - STOP!
- ...on there? - I think that his voice shook...
...something loose and the whammies couldn't come.
- (laughing) Yeah. - It's like, ""STOP! STOP!""
- That is exactly what didn't happen. - (laughing)
Here's what happened. So this ice cream truck driver had been studying the big
board for an extensive period of time. And he figured out there were two
squares that a whammy never showed up on. And he also figured out there were...
...five different patterns that you could follow the highlighted box around.
So he would sense which pattern it was and he knew when it was gonna go to
one of those two spots and he would STOP! the board. And he did this...
- ...45 times in a row. - 45 times in a row?
Meanwhile, producers are backstage freaking out. They can't bankroll this...
ice cream truck driver like this. The only reason he ends up stopping...
- We gotta STOP him! - ...is because he hit one of them that...
...wasn't one of the ones that he was thinking about and he lost confidence.
And so he stopped. He had more spins. He stopped at 110,000.
Okay. They figured out what he did. They analyzed the tape. They realized...
- ...that he had figured out the pattern. - Well, first of all, that's not cheating.
And they determined that it was not cheating.
- Yeah! - He got to keep all his winnings.
They went on to change the system so that it couldn't be gamed as easily.
But listen to what Michael Larson ended up doing. He ended up pressing his luck
even further. This guy couldn't get enough. He goes back home. There's a
radio contest where you can win $30,000 if you have a matching serial number
on a one-dollar bill that the radio station is reading out. He gets all
$110,000, after taxes, printed into one-dollar bills. So he has bags of
- one-dollar bills around his house. - (Link) You're kidding me.
He's checking the serial numbers to win 30,000 more. Well, his last
whammy was when he went to a Christmas party and someone stole all of his money.
The Price Is Right
Oh, no! That is horrible!
Sorry, Michael. Now he's also dead, which is kind of a big whammy, but...
I wonder what he would've said if he came home while they were stealing the money.
- STOP! - Yeah, that's probably it.
All right, I got one for ya. (announcer voice) ""Terry Kniess!
Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right!""
In 2008, he makes it to contestants' row. And this is no normal contestant.
This guy is a veteran blackjack card-counter.
- Yes. - He is a casino surveiller.
And he is a former TV weatherman. And you know what that means.
He can forecast how cold it's going to be in the studio.
- Patterns. Patterns. - Oh. Yes. That too.
First of all, when he gets down there, everyone's gotta bid on one item.
It's a grill. He guesses that it costs $1175. Pretty exact bid.
- And exactly right. Hm! - Oh!
- Raises a little suspicion. - Lucky. Lucky.
He then earns the right to go on stage. he makes his way through The Price...
- ...Is Right to get to the very end... - Showcase Showdown!
...the grand finale where he's pitted against someone else. They present
a whole bunch of prizes you can win, but you've got to give the total price
- of the total showcase. - Without going over.
Without going over. And if you're within $250, you win both showcases.
- I love it. - Now, this is the longest-running...
...show in television history. But what he did was amazing and outta nowhere.
- Let's watch the finale. - (host) You've got the tailer, jukebox.
You bid $23743. Actual retail price $23743. You got it right on the nose.
- What?! (bells ringing) - Double showcase.
- (Link) Right on the nose! - That hasn't happened since '72...
...or '73. Right on the nose. He won $56,437...
- (Rhett) Drew Carey is very subdued. - ...in prizes today.
- (Rhett) He was new at his job, I guess. - Don't forget to get your pets spayed...
- ...or neutered. - (Rhett) What is that smile about?
We'll see you next time on The Price Is Right. Bye bye.
Listen, whenever I have a big milestone, in my life where I do something amazing...
- ...I know who I'm not inviting. - (laughing)
- Drew Carey! - ""Ah, could've been anybody.""
Listen, here's the story. The reason why...
- ""I hate my job."" - It wasn't that. He's great at his job...
- ...and he loves his job. - Mhm.
But he was convinced that the guy was cheating because it had never...
- ...happened, basically. - (Rhett) Right. It's impossible.
And the producers were kind of having a conversation backstage.
But here's the facts. He wasn't cheating. It was a combination of studying
patterns and luck. He and his wife had taped and reviewed every single night
all the products and prices on Price Is Right, and it turns out that
they repeat them. And he remembered what they were. And then when he got to the
end, his wife's in the audience saying ""23,000,"" and then he just adds
743 because it's their PIN. That's what he said.
That's quite a system. So there was some luck involved.
Some luck in it. But Drew Carey was convinced that he was cheating and that
he was cheating and that it would never air. That's why he was so subdued.
But they did air it. They just buried it in December when nobody watches
Price Is Right as much. And then Price Is Right had to change their whole system
in the wake of Terry Kniess taking home all that stuff, including a karaoke machine.
Well, there you go. If you wanna win a gameshow, study the patterns,
drive an ice cream truck, and put your PIN number in wherever possible.

But I warn you that I left my heart at home
It's not the first time that this has happened to me

Stop right there, don't cross the line
Take it easy if you don't want me to leave
You could get up on me
But I warn you that I left my heart at home
It's not the first time that this has happened to me
I have seen your type of attitude many times
The more you try to hide it, I know know know it
It shows that you want my mouth
Careful because if it happens
You won't want to stop, ay ay
It shows that when you dance, you get wild
I know you're suffocated by my way of twerking
Nobeat music
Yeah

Oh, yeah, it's totally a Game Boy.
- ( Game Boy chiming ) - ( gasps )
Oh, love that sound.
I'm Marques Brownlee and I review dope, new tech.
But on this show I'm rewinding the clock
to discover the tech of the past
that changed our lives forever.
This is ""Retro Tech.""
All right, it's time to break the seal
Unboxing A Game Boy
on literally the oldest piece of tech I've ever held.
The Game Boy first came out back in April of 1989.
So this year is the 30th anniversary of its release.
Let's get in there. This is happening.
Ready?
The Game Boy is the most popular portable handheld gaming console ever.
And it kinda changed the course of gaming history.
I was not a part of that.
I never used the Game Boy. Never owned one.
So, this is a totally fresh
true first impression for me
of a piece of tech that changed history.
I recognize this guy. Don't worry.
I know who Mario is.
This is Tetris.
This is Tetris. I'm holding Tetris.
Let me pop this open.
I don't know how to open this.
Uh... think like 1989.
How would you...
Push.
I'm... pushing.
Oh, that's terrible. ( laughs )
That was, uh--
They could've done better there.
The unboxing experience has gotten better
since that piece happened in 1989.
This is it.
Wow, these are big buttons.
That is a thick console right there.
( music playing )
I'm gonna fire it up.
Oh, it lit up. Ooh.
( Game Boy chimes )
Okay, so I've got my Game Boy.
But this is the first time I've held a piece of tech
that I basically know nothing about.
So I wanna speak to some people
who've lived and breathed this thing
to find out its cultural impact over the past 30 years
and what made the Game Boy pop.
- Marques. - What's up?
Talking Nintendo
- Good to meet you. - As well.
So, to begin,
I'd like you to check under your seat.
Oh, my goodness. Am I in some-- Oh no!
- Oh, Game Boy! - ( Game Boy chimes )
First thing I'm gonna ask is for you to look under your chair.
All right!
Yes!
Oh!
Oh, memories.
( singing ) ? Memories ?
- ( Game Boy chimes ) - That little ping. Bing!
You guys need more batteries.
Brings back so many memories.
Yeah. That taste.
Remember when you used to suck on your Game Boy?
Was it just me? All right.
In 1989 when this came out, what were the '80s like?
( music playing )
The '80s were a time of a massive shift
in culture and technology.
This was the birth of personal technology.
I mean, this is when the Walkman first came out.
You had a lot less entertainment at your disposal.
There was no on-demand TV.
Life for a child was boring.
I mean, seriously, kids, like, you don't even know how good you have it.
You have smartphones.
You can even play on a tablet.
In the '80s it was just painful.
Good Lord.
At the time, gaming was largely in arcades.
? Here we go, here we go, here we go ?
And then all of a sudden, home consoles really made a play.
It was revolutionary.
Announcer: Everybody enjoys Atari.
No, we don't need a babysitter tonight.
Seth: The Atari was such a phenomenon
that all there other companies wanted to make video games
and get in on the action.
When it comes to space games, nobody compares to Atari.
Excuse me.
Have you compared them to Intellivision?
So a couple years later, Nintendo comes knocking and they say,
""You know, we have this video game system.""
People are skeptical
because Nintendo started out as a card company.
They made playing cards.
Do you know how old Nintendo is as a company?
I would be guessing it started in the '70s.
- 1970s? - Yeah.
- 1800s. Yeah. - Really?
Nintendo's been around for more than a hundred years.
It was only in the very early '80s
they start to think of themselves
as a technology company.
Nintendo just took over
and started spearheading the games industry.
It is the video game craze, the Nintendo craze.
Nintendo was the king of video games at this point.
You got all these great games. You got Duck Hunt.
You got Solomon's Key. You got Castlevania.
Dan: You had Zelda games.
You had Mario games.
You had all the big Nintendo stars.
Seth: So when the Game Boy was coming out
there was a little doubt that this was gonna be good.
And the designer behind the Game Boy was this guy named Gunpei Yokoi.
And famously he was one day on a very crowded train in Japan
and he saw a businessman just kinda poking away at a calculator
to kill time on his train ride.
And he thinks to himself what if he could actually have a real mobile game
he took could take with him on the train.
One of the great things about the early days of Nintendo
is they really believed in R&D, in experimentation.
So Gunpei Yokoi came up with first the Game & Watch
which was an interesting halfway step
between arcade games and home games and portable games.
( speaking foreign language )
It wasn't actually any good, but it was kinda clever
and fun and people liked it.
That was the beginning of Nintendo
dipping their toes into mobile games.
And then taking that forward, he evolved that concept
that started with the Game & Watch into the Game Boy.
Announcer: Now, you can have all the power
and excitement of Nintendo right in the palm of your hand.
Introducing Game Boy.
Nobody did hype like Game Boy did hype.
Sherri: It was revolutionary.
It's Nintendo in your hand.
The Game Boy promised to take these games that we love so much
and allow us to take it with us anywhere.
If someone came into school with one of them it was like they were the cool kid
and then everyone's crowding around
- in the classroom like looking at that thing, you know. - Yeah.
You turn it on, it was like, ""Ah! It's moving!""
And you can do stuff with it.
And I think it's something about maybe the design.
It's a very friendly design.
But this thing was made in the days
when people were worried about nuclear weapons.
Anything other than direct hit,
this thing could survive it.
There's a Game Boy that has survived a Gulf War bombing
and it's still playing Tetris today.
Still the single most indestructible piece
of gaming equipment we've ever had.
Marques: Durability is definitely vital to the success
Durability With Casey
of any piece of tech, old or new.
But is the Game Boy really as tough as they say?
To find out, I've asked YouTube legend and friend Casey Neistat
to come meet me at a Brooklyn warehouse.
I don't entirely know what I'm here for today,
but Marques invited me by
to play with one of my favorite childhood toys,
which I probably haven't seen since I was 12 years old.
That's all I know. That's all I know.
Marques, why-- why are we doing this again?
Okay, so there's a story of a Game Boy
surviving a bombing in the Gulf War.
And if it can survive that,
I kinda just wanna know where that breaking point is
'cause I don't-- I feel like it doesn't get much worse than that.
So, flamethrower, fire extinguisher.
I feel like I wanna-- I wanna man the fire extinguisher here.
- Okay, I'll man the flamethrower first. - Yeah.
I'm gonna ask for Brian. His assistance.
For making sure we do this safely.
I'd help you, Marques, but I'm just gonna stand over here instead.
You don't wanna, like, hold on to it or anything?
No, no, I'm good. You look great.
All right.
So we got the Game Boy over here.
I just have to trust my aim.
You can count on me, Marques.
All right.
( Casey screams )
Casey: That's so much fire.
Marques, what happened to your eyebrows?
Not the most comfortable backpack I've ever worn.
- Yeah. - All right.
( chuckles )
They're burning.
( indistinct chatter )
I think we have our first casualty, everyone.
Okay, here's the thing.
- The outside is-- is really-- - Severely melted.
Melted, charred.
- The buttons are now black. - It's burned all around, too.
The flame really encompassed the totality of the device.
It definitely wrapped around
and cooked the whole thing.
It also seems like the body was more susceptible
to just melting than the buttons. The real question is
are you gonna be able to get the cartridge in there?
Oh, that's gonna be the hardest part.
It-- It softened the back.
You're gonna, like, need the blowtorch again.
Melted it and now the cartridge might...
not... fit.
Maybe if you.
Maybe we should--
We should just put it on and just try
to give it everything you've got.
And that sounds promising.
- ( indistinct chatter ) - ( gasps)
- ( Game Boy chimes ) - Come on!
- Are you serious? - ( laughs )
Are you serious? What?
Okay, so the screen is toast.
- Is it, though? - But--
The screen is fine.
Oh, the screen under the protector is still on.
I feel like we have 100% functionality.
It completely does everything
that it did before it was literally blowtorched.
It just smells a little worse.
( coughs ) I'll agree with you on that.
- ( laughs ) - So that's--
That's about the most incredible thing
- I've seen in a long time. - That was like 12 hard hits.
I mean, it's not bad.
- It's impressive. It's impressive. - It's not bad.
Marques: Okay, so the Game Boy was undeniably built like a brick.
The Gameboy Experience
But the hardware is nothing without software.
So, what about the Game Boy experience
made it fly off the shelves back in 1989?
Big part of the Game Boy success
is that it was paired with the perfect game for it.
Announcer: Game Boy comes with the outrageous new game Tetris.
Tetris was the game that everybody had to play.
It was super addictive, super easy to get into,
difficult to master.
So it's like, ""Oh, maybe I am a gamer.
If I can play this, let me see what else I can play.""
Tetris has even a more unusual origin story than the Game Boy.
Tetris comes from the Soviet Union in the early '80s
where a computer scientist named Alexey Pajitnov
in his little lab came up with a game that he called Tetris.
Play Tetris with my friends.
Man: Okay.
And he just made little copies
and just kinda started selling it out the back of the van and backtracked
and tried to get the rights from the Russians later.
That lead to a series of lawsuits and fights.
Millions of dollars changed hands
and somehow Tetris ended up on every platform imaginable
and became a part of the daily lives
of millions of people around the world.
I have Tetris in my Game Boy.
You have Tetris in your Game Boy.
So I feel like we can go back in time a little bit
- 'cause we have the cable. - This is unbelievable.
Tetris was your gateway drug.
There was hit after hit.
You got Zelda Link's Awakening,
Super Mario Land, Metroid.
This is when Nintendo made its way to the American zeitgeist.
Dan: It became the background noise for so many things.
You'd see Hillary Clinton playing one on Air Force One.
Astronauts up in space stations would send back photos
- of themselves playing the Game Boy. - It's not going too well.
- I think I got your number. - I just lost.
- ( sighs ) - OG.
And if your Game Boy wasn't enough,
you could get a host of other weird,
wacky, and wonderful add-ons.
? Smile! You're on Game Boy camera ?
Most Game Boy accessories never really caught on,
but the Game Boy had the video game market share and fan base
that could support an ecosystem of third party accessories.
So, we've tracked down some of the most noteworthy accessories to the Game Boy.
And now I just kinda wanna see if they're any good or not.
This is Dope or Nope.
Dope Or Nope
All right, let's get it started. First accessory, please.
Okay, we have...
a Handy Boy by STD.
( chuckles ) Okay.
The slightly lower text screen was a bigger part
of why the Game Boy was so cheap and so appealing,
but if you wanted to play at night,
you need some sort of a light to see the screen at all.
Oh, yeah, that light is good.
There's a flip down.
So if I wanna do not magnified, I can.
And then I got the speakers.
- They're turned on. - ( Game Boy chimes )
Wow, that's loud.
( music playing )
I can't say I don't like it.
Honestly, if you're looking for, like, one accessory
to turn the Game Boy into something better
than it already is, this one's dope.
All right, what do we got.
This... not a whole lot of English on this box,
but this is the Pocket Sonar.
Let's-- Let's check this out.
Okay.
Okay, so this is the part
that goes into the back of the Game Boy.
And this is probably...
use the sonar to catch fish?
Do I--
Do I have any-- any way to demo this right now?
Is there a way to catch fish?
Uh... I'm almost scared to ask.
Uh-huh.
So... this won't be painful.
Trust me. It's just a little sonar.
These menus are not English so I'm gonna go ahead and assume
that the first menu option means start.
I-- I think I need a deeper body of water
for it to actually show the fish.
It's a-- It's an idea. It's a concept.
But I'm not sure this is gonna be winning me any dinners
in the next couple weeks.
So, basically, uh, Pocket Sonar.
Nope.
All right, next up.
Oh, part of it fell off. The Game Boy Camera.
Which at one point held the Guinness World Record
for the smallest digital camera.
The Game Boy Printer and printer paper.
How do I take a picture, though?
Oh, there-- Wow!
That is the viewfinder.
Holy smokes, that is actually not that bad.
And I'm gonna go ahead and hit A.
- ( Game Boy beeps ) - And it saves my photo.
That's my selfie. There's my first selfie on a Game Boy.
So now I think I'm ready to print.
And now I'm sending the print from the Game Boy
to the printer over this cable.
It's like a postage stamp sized little print here.
Uh, this is-- this is what the final print looks like.
It's not very good, obviously.
So, the printer, I'm sure it worked better back in the day.
Cool idea, but the execution not so great.
The Game Boy Printer, that's a nope.
But the camera, on the other hand,
that worked a lot better than I expected it to.
The viewfinder on the Game Boy screen was fine.
I can take selfies or photos
of other things with the same camera.
This is really impressive.
That's dope.
The Game Boy is truly an iconic piece of tech,
Chip Tunes
but back in the '90s it had to compete
with other portable gaming consoles
that seemed more state of the art.
( music playing )
The Game Boy was actually competing
against systems from Atari and Sega.
They had color screens.
Just big, loud displays.
Of course, you're like, ""Well, I want color.""
So you're gonna go with the Game Gear.
Wrong choice because for that color,
for that bigger display, you are paying in battery life.
You wanna go with something that lasts long.
Seth: The Game Boy was developed with this philosophy
that Nintendo really lived by.
It was lateral innovation by withered technology.
And what that meant was that they looked
for tech that might've been around for a couple years.
And the technology was mature enough
that they knew how to use it.
So while other companies were putting out systems
that seemed much flashier,
they didn't really know how to use all that flash.
Dan: Nintendo kind of did what Steve Jobs did
years and years later with the iPhone.
They really striped out a lot of what you didn't need.
It didn't have fancy controls.
It had a little D-pad and two buttons
and that was basically it.
It had very simple audio.
Sherri: And there was a slot in the back
for your cartridges and you would slide it on
and you just wait for the bing!
The audio you could only do basic bloops and bleeps.
And you go, ""Who would want that?""
Well, it turned into a whole music genre
that a lot of people love now.
Marques: The lo-fi sound of the Game Boy is so iconic
that it spawned a whole genre of music called Chiptunes.
So I've invited a Chiptune artist
who goes by Storm Blooper to show me how all this works.
Chiptunes is basically the creation of music
utilizing old video games sound chips.
So there's a specific chip in the Game Boys
- just for the music? - Just for the music.
Yeah, so it can only play four notes at any given time.
So, it's incredibly limiting,
but with that people have made some really insane compositions.
Marques: The Game Boy's internal memory is so small
that it can only handle a song about eight kilobytes in size.
In other words, one Chiptune song is about 500 times smaller
than one compressed MP3.
So, how do we get started making a Chiptune song?
- Okay, you ready to dive in? - I'm actually ready.
( Game Boy chimes )
You're not familiar with music creation, huh?
Not-- not really.
This is all super new to me. I guess I'll be going from scratch.
- ( music playing ) - So.
That sounds real good.
Let me-- Let me change this second note.
- Okay, okay. - ( music playing )
Beautiful.
- It slaps. It's good. - Okay.
Okay, so far so good.
I'm gonna give this-- this Boy back to you.
- I'm gonna let you be. I'm gonna let you do it. - All right.
Let's see what I can do here.
( music playing )
I'm-- I'm just trying to put together something
that flows from top to bottom and doesn't sound like trash.
( music playing )
I'm working on the not sounding like trash part
really hard right now.
( music playing )
Okay. All right.
Uh... I'm almost there with my--
with my masterpiece. ( laughs )
( music playing )
How'd I do? I mean, this is--
It's pretty good.
Let's bring in that kick drum, too.
Ready?
( music playing )
Boom. Professional.
- I can see a whole club bumping to this tomorrow. - Me, too!
I wanna see-- I wanna see what you've made
'cause this is just me in two minutes messing around,
but you've had way more time and experience.
- Let me see what you-- - Okay.
- What you got. - Let's do it.
( Game Boy chimes )
( music playing )
Marques: I definitely didn't expect
you could squeeze music this fresh out of tech this old.
Considering the short lifecycle of most tech around today,
the legacy of the Game Boy truly feels like something special.
Lasting Tech Legacy
So, I guess the last thing I'm trying to figure out is
the impact these things had on the tech we have today.
What do you think the Game Boy legacy is?
The Game Boy's legacy, it's hard to overstate.
Without the Game Boy you don't have the iPhone.
You don't have Candy Crush Saga.
You don't have smartphone gaming. You just don't.
The Game Boy singlehandedly changed technology forever.
Margaret: And the Game Boy was the beginning of the idea
of that everywhere we go in life have a thing in our pocket
that knew how to entertain us.
Seth: I mean, the Game Boy gave us control of free time.
It changed what free time was.
Dan: You would not see everyone on their iPhones
if not for the Game Boy and the huge influence it had on our culture.
And I think the legacy of the Game Boy
is that minimalism in technology design is a feature, not a bug.
Margaret: I think we've now kind of come full circle
to the simplicity and the purity of design.
What we saw reemerge with the first generation iPhone,
an absolute straight line that you can trace
from day one of the Game Boy.
This is so Zen. Right?
So clean and efficient and minimalist.
Sherri: The Game Boy is so well-designed.
So simple that you take for granted all the work
that went into giving you this piece of tech.
When you sell 200 million of anything,
it's tough to say it was not a gigantic success.
The Game Boy, besides being a huge seller,
has made all of us into gamers.
Sherri: And it became this worldwide phenomenon
thanks to the Game Boy.
So, okay, before all this, I felt pretty disconnected
to the Game Boy because I hadn't used one.
But now that I've talked to people
who have used the Game Boy and I've used it myself,
I've experienced the legend of its durability
and its companionship, now I get it.
And not only that, but I also now recognize the connection
between the Game Boy and the tech we have today.
Without this there would be no this
or many other pieces of tech we have today.
This is important.
Thanks, Game Boy.

RYAN DUFFY: Welcome to Bogota, Colombia. We're here chasing after the most dangerous drug in the world, burundanga.
Burundanga is the source of scopolamine, which is basically like the worst roofie you can ever imagine
times a million. You're at the whim of suggestions like, hey, take me to your ATM.
Hey, come with me to the hotel room-- while you're completely conscious and articulate.
Apparently there is a lot of different parts of the plant that are a bit dangerous, possibly a bit fun, depending
on what you're into. So we're going to be looking for the tree, talking to people who've had experience with it, and seeing if we can
find some of the actual drug ourselves.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
RYAN DUFFY: So the deal with burundanga is that it pretty much eliminates your free will.
So you're awake and you're articulate. And to anyone else watching you, it seems like you're perfectly fine.
But you've completely lost control of your own actions. So you're at the whim of suggestions. And that's how people take advantage of you.
I've heard a bunch of different stories really running the gamut. Some of them sound like campfire horror stories you're
told when you're growing up. Stuff like, waking up in a bathtub with an organ cut out and a sign saying, you have five hours
to get to the hospital. We've of course also heard that it's used as a date rape drug. We heard one particularly chilling story where a guy was
taken back to his apartment, woke up the next morning in an empty apartment completely confused as to what happened.
Went down and said to his door man, you know, why is my apartment empty? What happened?
The doorman said, well, you brought it out with two of your friends last night. All your stuff, you loaded it into a van. And the guy was like, why in the hell would
you let me do that? And he was like, because you told me to. So that's kind of the stuff we're dealing with here,
complete elimination of free will while still acting which is pretty much the scariest shit I can imagine.
[PLAYING MUSIC]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: Columbia's basically fucked. They had the longest running guerrilla war in all of Latin America. They've essentially been at civil war for 60 years.
And really if you think about it, they've never not been at war since they gained their own independence. Other fun facts about Colombia, definitely not from
the Board of Tourism, include the fact that one in every three kidnappings in the world happen right here in Colombia.
And as we all know, it's the cocaine capital of the universe. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: Now the borrachero tree, which by the way roughly translates to drunken binge tree, is indigenous to the
Northern Andean region. That includes Colombia, and Ecuador, Venezuela. But the scopolamine is really only used by the criminal
element here in Colombia. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: So despite the insane homicide rates, the kidnapping, the narco trafficking, the civil unrest,
and everything else going on in here in Columbia, we can't seem to find a Colombian who's more scared of anything than falling asleep under the borrachero tree.
[MUSIC PLAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: So far I'm really into Columbia. I showed up.
Beautiful women ordered me dinner. And it's fantastic. And they ordered a bottle of whiskey to the table.
I might not go back. [MUSIC PLAYING]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: So it's not something that is popularly done down here then?
RYAN DUFFY: Really? Not at all?
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: Do you know people that have been given burundanga? Do you have a cousin of a friend of a cousin?
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: We're here at the Botanical Gardens on the outskirts of Bogota. We're going to go see if we can figure out what this plant actually looks like.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
RYAN DUFFY: Those right there are the flowers that we've heard a lot about. And you can kind of put those in a tea and you'll
hallucinate. You can also take the root down there, put that in a tea. And again, you'll hallucinate.
And then there's the cacao, which kind of looks like the mini coconut of sorts.
That has the seeds inside. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: They actually just crack the thing right there. And then this is where the seeds are.
I mean, that's where everything comes from, right? SANTIAGO STELLEY: Yeah. That's what they use to actually make the scopolamine.
RYAN DUFFY: You're in business. The most dangerous drug in Colombia and arguably the world.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: The coke, at the end of the day, I mean, with its obvious pitfalls and dangers, is recreational.
SANTIAGO STELLEY: Yeah. RYAN DUFFY: Whereas there's nothing at all recreational about what can be made with this.
It's a distinctly criminal element. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: The irony of sorts is that it's beautiful. It's a very nice plant. And smells very nicely.
I'm enjoying this right now. SANTIAGO STELLEY: Seems quite Colombian all-in-all, very beautiful and very dangerous.
RYAN DUFFY: This is pretty much the symbol of Columbia isn't it? If you didn't know what you were looking for, you'd walk
right by and go, that's a pretty flower. Maybe I'll pick it and give it to my mom. But that would be a real bad idea.

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: So now we're here at the National University of Columbia. And we're going to go talk to Dr. Miriam Gutierez who heads
up the toxicology department here and apparently is an expert on scopolamine. We're going to try and chat with her a bit about what
actually happens when someone's exposed to the drug. And try and figure out what this whole zombie thing really means.

[MUSIC PLAYING]
RYAN DUFFY: Scopolamine is by no means a modern revelation here in Columbia. The indigenous people in this area have had a whole bunch of
uses for the drug. For example, when a chieftain died, all his assorted females, wives, mistresses, what have you, they
had to go as well. Now that could be a bit of a dicey process. But what better way to shore things up than to slip them
some scopolamine and suggest they walk into a grave. When they did, they were buried alive.
In modern times, there's a whole litany of fucked-up people who've been using scopolamine for their benefit.
For example, in the 1930s and '40s, Josef Mengele had the drug imported from Columbia to Germany to use in some of his
interrogations. More recently, the CIA tried to use the drug in the '60s during the Cold War as sort of a truth serum.
The problem with all of this is that in addition to a whole lot of truth, there's a good bit of hallucination involved.
We're in a cab right now heading over to the southern part of the city.
We're going to meet with officials at the Bogota City Police Department. What we're hoping to figure out is a little bit more about
how the burundanga gangs work. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[MUSIC PLAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: So it seems like a lot of the worst scopolamine stories that we've heard start and end at places just like this.
And the next thing we're able to get from someone is, I woke up on a park bench day and a half later, without my clothes
on, without any money, whatever it is. This drug has always been kind of inextricably linked to sex
in some way or another. From its earliest uses, to eliminating a lingering mistresses, to fallen chieftains, to its eventual
use in easing the pain of childbirth, to the stories we're hearing on the streets today about prostitutes giving
it to unsuspecting johns, or about men turning women into prostitutes by suggesting they go and earn some cash.
It always seems to come back to sex in one way or another. And it always seems to start at places like this.

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: So, so far we've heard a lot of stories about burundanga. But we'd like to get a little bit closer.
So we've asked some of our Colombian friends to put us in touch with someone who has an experience with burundanga.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
RYAN DUFFY: No idea. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
RYAN DUFFY: Oh, my God. That better be the scariest drug I ever see in person.
RYAN DUFFY: Don't let go of that fucking thing. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
SANTIAGO STELLEY: Are we done with it? RYAN DUFFY: I'm fucking over it, dude. After all this--
SANTIAGO STELLEY: Into the sewers? RYAN DUFFY: Anywhere but here.
Not bummed to see it go, I'll tell you that much.
Like when I first got here I was super interested in it. And it was like this novelty thing.
I've heard enough stories, man, that I'm just not fucking into that. It's not funny at all.

[Goofy] Whoa. Whoa.
[pigs oinking] Flying pigs? - [mooing] - [clucking]
- [whinnies] - [bleats] Now, there's something you don't see everyd...
[grunts] Say, what's the big idea?
Whoo boy! Looks like a super-duper storm is on its way. Which means we got a lot of wind whooshing around here!
Yeah! That wind could really wreck the farm, and if that happens, we won't have any food!
Shush and quiet, Mickey. [creaking] Would you listen to that?
Oh, the wind never sounded like that before! Come on, guys, hop in the Clickety-Clack Tractor.
Let's find out what's making that strange sound! [grunts]
[quacking] Come on, Mickey, go. Go!
Hold on, pal. We pull the red lever when we want to stop the tractor.
So which lever makes it go? [Goofy] Well, if red means stop, then green means go.
Do the green! Do the green! You got it, Donald.
[engine starts] [barking]
Gosh! Would you looky at that! It's a giant windy-mill! [creaking]
Farmer Pete! What's going on? Well, hi, Mickey the Farmer Mouse! [chuckles]
Sorry for all the wind. [chuckles] You see, I was using my new windmill
to keep all the bugs away from my prize petunias.
[Goofy] Farmer Pete, why don't you turn the windy-mill off? Because I don't know how!
The instructions blew away and now I don't know which lever to pull.
Let's see, there are three levers: Red, blue and green.
Remember how the red lever stopped the tractor before? So which lever do you think can make the windmill stop?
The red lever. [Goofy] Yeah! 'Cause red means stop!
Let's try it.
The Missing Animals
We did it! The windmill stopped! [grunts] Ooh! So that's where those went.
[chuckles] [Donald muttering angrily] - Thanks, everybody! - [all] You're welcome!
[Goofy] Uh, guys, something wrong here.
Gee, Goof's right. Something's missing! Do you see what's missing on the farm?
That's it! The animals. Golly! They must've flown away like birdies!
Come on, let's all find the animals together. Are you ready?
Great! - OK, guys, keep your eyes open! - And your noses, too!
- [sniffing] - [Mickey] Attaboy, Pluto! Find all the farm animals.
[barks] I think Pluto found something. But I don't see any animals.
And I don't hear any moo-moos or oink-oinks - or cluck-clucks either. - Where could they be?
I've got an idea. I bet if we plant lettuce and carrots,
then the animals will come out for a treat. Sounds yummy. But, uh, won't it take a long time to grow all that stuff?
Not with the Clickety-Clack Tractor. Watch!
? Growin' veggies on the farm ? ? Is always lots of fun ?
? Our tractor likes to plant the seeds ? ? One by one by one ? ? And with a clickety-clack and a poppity-pop ?
? Things begin to grow ? [all] ? Clickety-clack and a poppity pop ? [Mickey] ? Everything's ready to go ?
? Clickety-clack and a poppity-pop ? ? There's somethin' for everyone ? ? Clickety-clack and a poppity-pop ?
[Mickey] ? Plantin' veggies is fun ?? [chuckles] [chuckles] Now all we have to do is wait for the animals to come out
and get their treats. [Goofy] Come out, come out, wherever you are.
[Donald] We found bunnies! ? Oh Mickey and Donald have a farm ? ? Meeska-mouseke-doo ?
? And on our farm we've got bunnies ? ? Meeska-mouseke-doo ?
? With a bunny hop here and a bunny hop there ? ? Here a bunny There a bunny ? ? Everywhere a bunny-bunny ?
? Mickey and Donald have a farm ? ? Meeska-mouseke-doo ? [bleats]
[Mickey] ? And on our farm we've got a goat ? - ? Meeska-mouseke-doo ?? - [bleats]
Now, let's see... How many animals are there? Count with me, everybody.
? One bunny, two bunnies Three bunnies, four ? ? Five bunnies, six bunnies Are there any more? ??
Well, there aren't any more bunnies, but we've got a goat. And that's an animal. [chuckles]
So we've got one, two, three, four, five, six bunnies, and a goat, too.
And that makes how many animals? Seven!
[chuckles] Hot-diggity-doo, you're right! Good for you!
The Happy Farm Family
Um, Mickey, I don't think there's enough room on the tractor for all of the animals. No problem, Goofy. Watch this!
Come on, let's skedaddle, don't be lagging. Hitch up to the Clickety-Clack Wagon!
[bleats] Now, that's what I call a happy farm family.
[horse whinnies] - Did you hear that? - [whinnies]
Sounds like there's another animal around here. Come on!
[horse whinnies] Uh, did you whinny, Minnie? Oh, my, no! [giggles] It wasn't me.
[both] It was her! [whinnies] [Goofy] Bust my buttons! We've got to help that horsey!
Well, maybe a Mouseketool can help the little lady float down safely. Come on, everybody say, ""Oh Toodles!""
[all] Oh, Toodles!
One Mouseketool coming r-r-right up!
[Mickey] We have the handy fishing pole, the blimpy blazer, a soft blanket,
and the mystery Mouseketool. Which Mouseketool can we use to help the pony float down safely?
[Daisy] Yeah. The blimpy blazer! It's good for flying and floating.
[Donald] Well, let's give it a shot. [Mickey] We've got ears, say ""Cheers!""
- [pops] - [whinnies] [frightened whinnying]
- [Donald grunts] - [impact] - [barks] - [cheering] Great! We got the pony down safely!
Um, has anyone seen Donald? [Donald, muffled] Aw, phooey!
Why does this always happen to me? [chuckles]
[both laughing]
Ride along with us, little pony!
[happy whinnying] ? Oh Mickey and Donald have a farm ?
? Meeska-mouseke-doo ? ? And on our farm we have bunnies ?
- [Goofy] A goat. - [bleats] - [Donald] A pony. - [whinnies] ? Meeska-mouseke-doo ? ? With a ""howdy-howdy!"" here ?
? And a ""Yahoo!"" there ? ? Here's fun, there's fun Lots of fun for everyone ? ? Mickey and Donald have a farm ?
? Meeska-mouseke-doo ?? [pig oinking]
Oink Oink
[oinking continues] Did someone just, ""oink, oink, oink""? - Nope! - Not me.
Uh-uh. Did you, ""oink, oink, oink?""
Hmm. Then who do you think went ""oink, oink, oink""?
Piggies? Yeah. They've got to be around here somewhere. And I think their oink-oinks are coming from over there.
[oinking] The Cluck-Cluck Chicken Coop?
[gasps] Those aren't chickens. They're... little piggies!
[oinking] [Mickey] Uh-oh! The basket at the bottom of the slide is gone
and the piggies need a safe place to land. We need a Mouseketool!
Everybody say... [all] Oh, Toodles!
Y-Y-You called?
[Mickey] Let's see, we have the handy fishing pole, a soft blanket, and...
[Donald] Oh! Oh! The blanket! [Goofy] Yeah, that's soft and comfy.
[Mickey] We've got ears, say ""Cheers!""
[oinking]
[Goofy] ? We got three little piggies in a blanket ? ? What a silly sight ?
? I bet they could stay in there and oink-oink-oink ? ? Oink-oink-oink all night ?
[oinking] ? Three little piggies in a blanket ?
? What a sight to see ? ? Listen to 'em oink-oink-oink-oink-oink ?
? Just for you and me ? [oinking]
[Goofy] ? One, two, three ?? - [oink] - [Goofy laughs]
Mickey, make room for three more. The more, the merrier! [chuckles]
[barking] [Goofy] One piggy, two piggy, three piggy.
[oinking]
[Clarabelle] Oh, cluck-cluck chickens! Come out, come out! - That sounds like Clarabelle! - And she sounds worried.
Cluck Cluck
Oh, cluck-cluck chickens, where are you? Uh, Clarabelle, do you need help?
Oh, Mickey! Oh, thank goodness you're here! My cluck-cluck chickens and I were at the coop happily singing,
when suddenly, out of nowhere, the big wind blew them this way and that way!
Whoa! Those chickens must've flown the coop! [gasps] And they're gone, too!
Oh, my! Whatever shall I do? Do not fear, m'lady.
Your friends are here! We'll find them chickens! Uh, Mickey, uh, how can we find them?
Let's all sing a song together, and I bet the cluck-cluck chickens will come out and join in!
Come on, everybody, let's sing! ? Oh, Mickey and Donald have a farm ?
? Meeska-mouseke-doo ? ? And on our farm we have cluck-cluck chickens ? ? Meeska-mouseke-doo ?
? With a cluck-cluck here and a cluck-cluck there ? ? Here a cluck, there a cluck Everywhere a... ?
[clucking melodically]
? Mickey and Donald have a farm ? ? Meeska-mouseke-doo ??
[clucking melodically] Oh, thank you, Mickey! Thank you for finding my cluck-cluck chickens!
A million thank-you's to you. [blows kiss] Aw, helping friends is what friends are for.
- [cow moos] - [gasps] Uh, Clarabelle? Well, that wasn't me, Mickey.
But who could have made that moo? [confused mooing]
Cowabunga! Mrs. Cow is stuck in that tire like a cork in a bottle!
We've got to get her out of that tire swing safely. Maybe I can help.
Oh, this I got to see! - [confused moos continue] - Hold on, Mrs. Cow,
I'm gonna slow you down. Whoops. Oh!
Come to papa, little hat. - [moos] - [impact]
- [screams] - Watch out! - [screams] - Whoa!
[Donald] Watch where you're going! [crashing]
Goofy! Listen, guys, it's not safe to get too close to a swinging cow.
Or to a Goof! But, Mickey, if we can't get close, how can we get Mrs. Cow out of the tire?
Well, I think we need... [interrupts] A Mouseketool! I was just gonna suggest that. [laughs]
[chuckles] Everybody say, ""Oh, Toodles!"" - [all] Oh, Toodles! - [horn honks]
Oh, l-l-let me guess. You need a Mouseketool. We sure do!
[Goofy] Gee-golly. We have the mystery Mouseketool and the handy fishing pole.
[Mickey] Oh! What if we use the handy fishing pole to catch the tire and hold it steady?
[Goofy] Yeah! Then the tire would stop swinging. [Donald] And the cow, too!
[Mickey] Good thinking, everybody! We've got ears, say ""Cheers!""
OK, here I go! [grunts] [mooing]
Huh? [screams]
I did it! Okey-dokey, Mrs. Cow. Everything's all right now.
Just wiggle yourself out and...
Mystery Mousekatool
[moos]
[thunder crashes]
Uh-oh! [Goofy] Gosh.
We might be in for a real storm. You think it could be trouble? I know it is!
We need to blow away these stormy clouds. And that means we need a Mouseketool.
Everybody say, ""Oh, Toodles!"" [all] Oh, Toodles!
I-I-It's me to the rescue!
[Goofy] Gosh, all that's left is the mystery Mouseketool. [Mickey] Everybody say...
[all] Mystery Mouseketool! [Mickey] What's today's mystery Mouseketool?
Whoa! Pete's windmill! [Goofy] Pete's windmill? But that's what blew all the animals away!
[Mickey] Yeah, but now we can use it to blow all the clouds away. We picked all our Mouseketools! Say ""Super Cheers!""
Goofy, Donald, pull the lever that makes the windmill go. Hm, let's see now.
Red means stop, so it's not the red lever. But what color means go?
[Donald] I know! I know! Green means go! That's right, Donald! Let's try the green lever!
- [Goofy] Great! We did it! - [Donald] Yeah! Come on, everybody, let's bring all the animals back to the farm.
[Minnie] Hooray! We saved the farm! - Oh, goody-goody! - Moo-arvelous!

welcome back to another mod shoe keys
and today we are gonna take a look at
the too much tnt mod this mod adds in a
lot of different TNT and some are just
really big explosions while others have
some unique abilities as well I'm not
gonna be going over all the different
recipes honestly there is just too much
TNT I would suggest using not enough
items if you're using this mod because
yeah you're not gonna remember all these
anyway and I'll take up a lot of video
when we could just be blowing stuff up
just as an example I'll show you guys
normal TNT you know it makes a tiny
little explosion but there is some
pretty epic stuff here so yeah that is
normal TNT this right here is TNT times
5 so it basically makes like five times
the size explosion and if you don't have
a good computer it's probably gonna
struggle on some of the bigger ones and
here we go
BAM pretty big size but they get really
big this green one times 20 and I've
even had some issues with the really
large ones on but we'll see what happens
alright here we go times 20 TNT wait for
it BAM
now that is a big explosion I mean you
could have a lot of fun with this just
be careful if it's like your normal
minecraft world you may want to back it
up in case you have an accident this one
right here is TNT times 100 and if you
don't have a decent PC this one may
crash your minecraft but I'm here we go
this one is sick and I'd better get a
good view of this times 100 it's like
having a hundred pieces of TNT right
there and it's sometimes it takes a
second and that goes Oh God there we go
now that is an explosion and I believe I
actually found a mineshaft yeah dead
mine shaft like right down there on the
one after this is times 500 and it
crashes my minecraft like 80% of the
time but I can show you guys what it
looks like after it blows up alright
guys this is what happened after I blew
up the times 500 TNT it like really
destroyed my world over here as you
could tell this is just one piece of TNT
that did this and everything is
destroyed and yes sorry I can't show in
video it lags pretty damn bad anyway and
it sometimes crashes my
craft as well and there's an even worse
TNT meteor TNT which I'll show you guys
next so guys this is the aftermath of
the meteor TNT and yeah this is like the
biggest explosion ever and it really
wrecked some havoc around here and these
are the only two tees I couldn't show
you guys the actual explosion for all
the other ones should work in video this
is just one of those that really can
crash you if you don't have a very good
computer and mine is good and it still
crashed me a bunch of times but yeah
this is what the explosion looks like
there's actually like a dungeon right
here that is pretty weird and I'm so
just tempted to I can't not look I have
a problem like I have to no diamond
horse armor music desk and a bunch of
other stuffs oh yeah I just can't not
look it it'll drive me crazy alright
guys the next one is called the flat
bomb TNT and this one like flattens out
in area maybe we can kind of flatten
this out see if you can hear alright and
most of these zombie too bad you should
be able to run the other tnt's some of
them are pretty big but should be able
to handle this and kind of flatten it
out a bit here so if there's like a hill
in the way you could probably just like
blow it up with that um this one's
really cool the mining flat bomb so you
get far underground and you really want
to like spread out for some mining this
one is the one for that so what I'm
gonna do is like dig underground really
click here and blow it up and we can
have like our own mind set up and I'm
pretty sure there's torches that goes
with this one too so here we go I'm
right in my face
DMT in my face and bam that's pretty
cool isn't it so now you have this like
area where you can mine I could even see
like iron and coal I thought this was
like one of the coolest ones so the next
one we're gonna look at is the compact
TNT and this one is definitely a lot of
fun I'm gonna put it in the forest it's
really gonna destroy this for us badly
but here we go
blow it up I love mods like this there's
so much fun to mess around with and here
we go and it turns into regular TNT
which all ignites as well that's why
it's so cool and the explosion is
growing TNT jumping all over the place
and you end up with a really big crater
too I'm now we're actually on to some
like weirder ones like this one makes
you a house like you can make a house
out of TNT whoo nib so we blow it up
it's actually not you know very
dangerous this one and bam
got myself a house gotta cool it is made
of cobblestone there really isn't too
much to it but I kind of like the idea
that they put something unique like this
in there's a crafting table in it and I
believe there are a couple more houses
so I'm gonna put these away and we've
got the brick house and the wood house
so through the wood house first and then
we'll do the brick one so let's get a
little room right here and we will blow
it up
not that I'm really blowing anything up
I'm like creating I'm a creator and this
one is a little bit better it's like an
upgrade let me find the door getting
lost here and yeah this one um there's
actually a furnace in it there's nothing
in the furnace don't worry check it for
you and a bed as well and the best one
of course is the brick house so make it
right here and yeah I think this is it
for the like creating a building
explosives Oh chicken are you alright
yes fine don't worry that he got like
hit in the wall right there so yeah this
is the best one it has like a nice floor
made of wool on the bed something got
messed up there but normally works and
there's a furnace and this one even has
a chest in it too so pretty cool so the
next one is fire TNT you could probably
imagine what this does and I love the
animation some of them are really cool
so we're about to start a fire right now
BAM
fire all over the place I think that is
so cool I'm not sure why you'd want to
do it maybe to kill some mobs or
something um let's try to comment down
with some snow yeah there is snow TNT as
well like I mentioned there's a lot of
unique versions of TNT like they did a
lot with this mod snow so if you want
your house in like a snowy type area you
gotta could add some snow to her if you
just want like snow for some snow golems
that'd be perfect and this one is the
ocean Tod and it like literally creates
an ocean sort of it's like a lake here
we go and it looks so cool there's like
water coming out of it probably should
back up a little bit though and there we
go there's even squids look at them
they're swimming through it and it looks
like it connected to everything else but
um yeah the water is like flowing down
I've noticed this sort of an issue like
the water will just stop in one spot and
start flowing down but it definitely is
very cool
I'm the next one is Hellfire probably
shouldn't be near the water for that one
and this one is interesting I haven't
seen anything like this before
all right so Hellfire kind of makes it
in the nether and that is awesome right
there ready for a cool explosion and
here we go come on it's big it's time
it's freaking me out actually and there
we go there's gas around and a lot of
fire and as you can tell some of these
take a few seconds to actually like
generate probably because they're so
cool and there's like lava there - I'm
so the next one this one's important
vaporized what it does it gets rid of
lava and water so probably gonna want to
try it like you know next to the water
so it actually does something so we'll
put it right there and we will blow up
vaporize this water fell right in the
water it should work doesn't actually
destroy blocks and there we go got rid
of a lot of the water right there so
yeah if you want to get rid of an ocean
you definitely could do that alright so
we are onto the end or bomb this one is
interesting - it doesn't like teleport
you but it knocks you back like a
million feet so I'm gonna stand right
here right in front of it creative mode
it works - and here we go whoa how sick
was that so yeah it knocked me really
far away now I'm falling to my doom so
if you were in survival that probably
would be a problem I'd imagine alright
now we're on to the nucular
TNT so this one right here I think this
is the one that puts like this like
nuclear waste on the ground I'm not 100%
sure till we do it though I'm pretty
sure it kills trees though and here we
go I'm so impatient I just want to blow
up and yeah that would knock me back -
and all this stuff on the ground is
nuclear waste and I'm pretty sure it
hurt the trees yeah it doesn't look so
good over here
big explosion knock me back and nuclear
waste everywhere and if you're in
survival if you step on this it hurts
you like this sheep right here
do you mind testing this for us let this
hurt you take it well yeah it's
dangerous
Oh God get off it it's dangerous okay
it's too late now the Sheep has died
rest in peace alright guys so the next
TNT is freeze TNT and what it does it
like freezes everything
around it like this tree will become an
ice tree in one second we will test it
here we go
and yeah this tree should completely
freeze into ice BAM pretty cool I like
it as a cool look to it the tree is
obviously very unhappy but um you can
definitely turn things into ice and this
one is the floating TNT it like Rises
into the air and then explodes like I'm
trying to find like a good spot to use
this where it would really help us like
I don't know why you would actually use
it but um it is interesting so I put
down like at the bottom of this very
very small mountain actually maybe down
here to be better you know put it in
here and it's gonna rise into the air
and explode look at it going up I hope
the pig survives it might not I'm pretty
sure it's a decent-sized explosion yeah
it was a nice explosion pretty big right
it really destroyed the land I'm the
next one is chemical TNT there is just
so many kinds of TNT here and this one
I'm not sure what it does I can't
remember but yeah it does that cool like
explosion down into the ground you ought
to get down deep that is gonna work like
chemicals
some have destroying the land alright
Saranda erupting TNT I feel like it like
a rub some more TNT or something like
that
yeah there we go TNT flying into the air
and coming down and exploding the pig is
watching and then he died so yeah that
is very awesome right there I'm the next
one is cubic TNT this one it kind of
just makes like a cubed area like a
small cube area so I'll explode it right
right there and you'll see what I mean
this one not too spectacular like some
of the other ones but it does something
useful I guess so yeah it made a square
for you so if you wanted to build a base
underground it might be really useful
but other than that I'm not really sure
why you'd use it the next one is
multiplied t on what this one does it
like multiplies the blocks it blows up
it like doubles them but it doesn't work
with any good block so don't put like
diamonds around it cuz you're not gonna
get double blocks back so you're gonna
see I'm gonna get like a lot of dirt
compared to how much blew up like right
there yeah there's a lot of dirt and
stone right there
like double the amount any good ORS just
won't work like you can't like cheat and
get extra like that then you can just
like keep blowing stuff up over and over
again on this one
goosed TNT what it does it actually
sinks down into the ground and then
blows up down there obviously it's gonna
be hard to tell where it blew up so just
to show you guys an example I'm gonna
put one at the top of the jungle tree
and then we'll actually be able to see
the explosion cuz I don't want to dig
all the way under the ground trying to
find where it exploded alright now we
could find this it's probably just a
little bit deeper here alright where are
you there we go
so yeah I made this hole right here here
mobs so yeah if you wanna make a hole
underneath the ground from above the
ground you now are able to do that so
the next TNT to look at is drilling TNT
and what it does is it drills a hole
down basically to bedrock it's like a
one hole down you'll see what I mean in
a second oh I was wrong that was the
wrong one that one does a big hole dig
don't fall in what are you doing what
are you doing why you committing suicide
don't do that what why would you do that
you didn't have to you jumped like five
times right there um I gotta confuse
with this one digging TNT does the one
hole I know they look really similar
that's why so yeah that's the good one
this is the mediocre one want to get
down to the ground like once well don't
go in there he's looking in it's too
dangerous
don't go in your friend you saw what
happened to him he got stuck in the hole
the same could happen to you I won't
allow it
see you listen to me but yeah this one
is much bigger and cooler all the
animals are like getting tricked by it
they want to go in alright so this one
is the timer TNT and it like takes a
while to blow up I'll show you guys
right here um so it's gonna switch back
right now it's in green that means you
have a long time it's kind of like a
streetlight you know when it's green you
have plenty of time just go then it
turns to yellow you have less time I'm
pretty sure that's what it's based off
of it has to be and now that it's
turning red it's gonna blow up soon so
you might want to get away not a big
explosion but I like the idea of it like
that would actually be useful and like
survival cuz you'd have time to like run
away not to kill yourself alright so we
are on to reaction to yet
it's pretty cool-looking I like that all
the TN t--'s look like completely
different it is a blue color to it got
like some kind of weird colors coming
off it and here we go
giant explosion that was pretty sick oh
my god it's never-ending
it is never-ending now that is a big
explosion see the cool thing is some of
these T's don't go in like one shot like
the times 501 so you can get a big
explosion like this without it like you
know destroying your Minecraft cuz it
does it like a little bit at a time and
another dungeon these are driving me
crazy
why are there so many of these around
what's in here guys just checking
I was curious don't mean to bother you
and your little home here what's the
next one anyway I'm animal TNT this
one's kind of cool it actually isn't
just animals it probably should be
called mob TNT what it does it creates
like all the mobs in Minecraft and like
one cluster so we'll put it down right
here I wouldn't call them animals but
you know you can if you want and it's
about to explode BAM
lots of animals and stuff there's
mushrooms it's pretty weird isn't it
which is zombie pigmen if you really
want to fight you like that TNT alright
so the next one is sand firework so what
its gonna do is make fireworks for you
but it's out of sand get ready for it
here comes the sand
I think it's cool though and now there
is sand all over your world I would
actually hate that and survive I'll be
like oh my god I got to clean this up
now look terrible okay so this one the
floating island TNT what it does it
copies the ground like let's say um this
stuff over here what is going on are you
alright
saved your life big I thought you were a
sheep for some reason oh that's gonna
copy the ground and put it into the air
the thing is you can't put like diamonds
there you know so you get extra diamonds
it just doesn't work that way it doesn't
work with any good blocks
I like the block though and it still
looks like TNT cuz the top it looks
pretty awesome here we go we're gonna
blow it up and this gram should be in
the air wait for it
get a good view
come on this is another where the was
it's kind of hard to generate and some
stuff fell but she gives at the top here
imagine they'll be trees yes there we go
so yeah here's all the sand and
everything you can't bring like diamonds
and stuff up that's one of the downfalls
of it but it's very cool you can have
like a house up in the air so the next
one is gravity TNT and what it does it
grabs like everything towards it the
gravity grabs it and I am even getting
pulled in I'm trying to get far enough
away so it doesn't happen to me and
they're all gonna get thrown into the
air it is so awesome oh here we go blow
and there they come high into the air
and crashing down obviously easily
killing everything but how cool is that
Oh more moose shrimps oh it's raining
the chicken is the chicken is trying to
float its way down safely that is so
nice I've never seen anything like that
before
that's pretty awesome umm but yeah you
can kill a lot of mobs with that and
just make them rain from the sky alright
the next one another like sky thing this
one is TNT fireworks and here we go TNT
should rain down and it happens for a
while too like there's lots of
explosions and what I noticed is after a
bit like one or two will still keep
flying down like it is right now they
come down for like a minute it's very
cool yeah big explosion the land here
I've totally annihilated this world for
this review any more TNT check-in I
heard another there's another one see
they keep coming down alright so we are
on to Easter TNT actually just called
Easter Egg I thought it was Easter too I
thought everything was TNT but um this
one right here basically it's gonna make
a lot of different stuff you'll see in a
second I'm sorry guys that are close to
this and yeah there are pumpkins and
melons it's not done either it keeps
going more of them blowing up I don't
even want to move it's freaking me out
so yeah if you have really want pumpkins
and melons
you can get so many I've never seen so
many pumpkins and melons in my life like
he doesn't even wanna load here but ya
can't kind of weird right um there is
one
or kind of TNT called custom TNT
basically you can go into the config
file and customize it to how big of an
explosion and stuff like that I didn't
actually do anything with it but um you
can make something really cool you can
even make a giant massive explosion if
your computer can handle it and
definitely have some fun with that they
actually also added in some dynamite and
it's pretty much the same as TNT but I
believe it's a little bit weaker that is
normal dynamite times 5 and these don't
crash your Minecraft as easily I've
noticed times 20 this one times 100
throw right in the middle there we go
and 500 should work this has worked for
me every time tried it big explosion
come on Doug crash me I'm actually
nervous now there we go yeah that is
that is a nice explosion right there and
we're gonna try the meteor one which is
like the ultimate D&D in this mod and
you can actually see like a meteor come
down see it in one second
come on meteor there it is and there we
go a massive crater they like knock me
back and there's like fire in it too I'm
this one is flat dynamite flatten it out
of it here try to get down to actually
see it didn't really flatten it out that
much let me try it again throw a couple
yeah this is one of the last mods you're
ever gonna work with and here comes the
mining one again let me just toss it
like in there like that and yeah like
flattens it out for you it's pretty cool
so they actually didn't make dynamite
for every single kind of TNT yet but I
figured I should just show you guys them
all anyway on this one it's compact
dynamite nice explosion there and then
those should blow as well and I feel
like the dynamite will work a lot better
if your PC isn't that good I mean they
seem to you know not lag me too badly
this one's fire dynamite turn everything
into flames
snow dynamite snow in the ocean dynamite
ocean right there vaporize let's get rid
of it there we go
I'm sorry squids here is Hellfire once
again there's a ghast for us and let's
see what is left and or dynamite just
throw me back if you can there we go and
the last wall
chemical dynamite I really like that one
the fax just looks so cool it made a
really big hole down there so yeah guys
that is about all there is to show with
this mod there are tons of kinds of
explosives to mess around with if you
want to check it out the download is in
the description and if you enjoyed the
review I'd really appreciate it if you
left a like and subscribed it really
does help me out thanks for watching
guys I will see you next time"
Jesser,"17,200,000","4,336,371,409","1,317",Gaming,2012,"so for the player introductions they had
us come through the outside door said
everyone was kind of lined up and I'm
not gonna lie it was super intimidating
just seeing all those people are just
walking through it so Chris actually
like he might have tore his rotator cuff
we don't know yet he's lucky an MRI and
his shoulder was hurting so bad he's
like oh god they're all gonna start
slapping me and high-five Envia when he
wet he's like oh my shoulder cuz they
were all like I five the game itself
[Applause]
I didn't even realize this happened but
someone actually slapped me in the face
and I didn't even realize I just saw it
on Twitter but it was pretty funny
[Music]
so in the warmups the crowd was like any
time one of us made it they actually got
Heights like what crowd gets hyped for
the warm bus so I was like you know if I
don't go probably get pretty excited
so whatever and um and you know roads
are dunking I could we were deciding on
the starting lineup and then the crowd
just started chatting this
[Applause]
[Applause]
they really wanted Lord Lewis in the
game so starting for the tip up I lined
up on enemy lines I got the ball and I
literally just tried to get fouled so I
went into OSN threw up a crazy shot I
didn't get fouled or draft in a car I
thought I might have been found who
knows it was a horrible shot either way
so it's whatever I missed it and Caesar
grabs that just goes out to the
three-point line
perfect splash right after that they
have to get it back DDG hits unpacks and
- this is an amazing 3-point shooter he
just lets it Ceaser's taking the ball of
the court you can just tell he has
insane handles by the way juggles if he
finds cash in the corner a little
nervious my man air ball did but it's a
little good then i'll coming down
looking like a lean machine - the legs
crossed all the way and one bank
I just want to say this I literally hate
myself so much every time I do something
cool you'll see later in the video too I
do this like I'll score I'll be like
score good job I do these small little
claps that are so lame and uncool - the
lockdown defender was guarding - right
here Mew is really the star of their
team he drove in I don't play any held
events and he got the layup I really
should have stepped it in helps I was
just lazy after six minutes the score
was 12 to 12 a very even match we
switched out the sun's Malcolm got the
ball and he hit a pretty intense
contested jumper that was really nice
and then they came down
Geron had a really nice reverse layup on
us it was going back and forth after
that my man tried to come down again in
sauce but he slipped Drona with the
steel Haas Walker wide open the ball
slips and I don't know why James did he
tried just you know grabbing it again
maybe the ref didn't see that it was a
double if he did that but he just let it
go out of bounds and the plans is that
James has a super sweet spin move goes
through two defenders and misses the
layup to his credit he did hurt his
pinkie really bad it's like black and
blue right now it's really ugly
China has an ugly pinky he got hurt didi
found Malcolm in the corner Malcolm
joven and he has his signature step back
and he just hits it it's a beautiful
song right here Zak had kto on him faked
out the cameraman and he was like okay
I'm scoring I came to you I'm driving in
easy layup he can't hold Zak let's be
honest at this point it is 26 to 16 and
our team is getting off to a big lead
right here was kind of repulsive
dangerous you can just watch
get over here
I took out Walker from behind pulled it
back that's a very dangerous play like
this the technical is a flagrant you
don't do that because someone get really
hurt Walker was really like triggered
you could tell they almost square it out
low key if there was one person on that
Court I wouldn't want to square up with
it would definitely be Walker so I don't
know what he's doing well your two
fingers would squish me like sushi right
now stop playing we had an inbound
down-low
Zak cut to the basket and got the
and-one
but it was kind of triggered at that you
can tell him we're gonna do it at the
round like it's a really light foul
I don't know how he's like that's not
about the only reason I'm getting all
over this is cuz he tweeted like the
rest were rigged or something
no after that the lead just started
increasing 20 new caskets at and one he
just starts being bugging the opponents
it's actually pretty funny if our team
was just feeling themselves right your
Caesar has a whirlwind spin that was
insane and then find Zach - we were just
hot
we're on fire Zach - it's the three we
were just feeling ourselves look at that
celebration he's having a good time he's
happy right here I'm guarding my
arch-nemesis Jay Jonesy it's here the
little step-back contested Rick and then
Walker gets the board while consuming to
create the fast break he throws it
overhead to me
I gotta get stuck on Jay Jones I just do
a little spin and then I lose the ball
but I find Sam for another three
back-to-back okay Zach Roth missed
unfortunately but that doesn't mean our
team still doesn't hot walker out of 3/4
and Walker just took it and just
splashed in from we were so hot everyone
was doing good I'm driving the ball down
to the wing I just stopped and I'm like
I'm gonna give it to Cesar no one's
guarding him but he has the most
ridiculous jelly I've seen in the game
that was insane scores 42 to 26 we have
another break so I just run to the
corner Cesar finds me mrow I was feeling
myself over threes bag let's go
[Music]
you know after that Lowe's has to redeem
himself he's coming back from the place
so he gets the steal
there's no got no idea when she was here
and he does the fake pass that just gets
him and then he shoots it bro if he made
that that would have been so sick I mean
Zach got the layup and made it anyway
but it would've been so cool buzzer
beater time Jay Jones halftime
interviews from other debonair
I do
to be within four
I feel about the first afro exact how
you feel out that first half
we're here to do what it is to yo I had
time we were like bro we have to get
mopey the ball we have to get mopey a
point this is a blowout this is mopey
minutes he needs to shine it's just what
happened
they really out here double-teaming
mopey I'm selling a little a little
bleep car these are found cash at the
top of the key for the three-pointer I
got the rebound and if you have my
videos you know I like my little fade
away hit him with the fade my slow fade
game is insane man if you know what I'm
saying you know you wanna know what
Cassius about driving it was his love
and one Reba
we do it again
the answer was yes I'm just so happy
with how everything went literally our
team was just so hot Zach with a quick
full of three just nails it like these
times are normal for us usually to be a
missing piece but we were just all
feeling it it was amazing I mean -
children for the lab we were just
offering so much at this point then
whatever they did it really didn't
matter I show you my highs and I show
you my lows I got crossed up by flight
Brooks bow him he's sick let me answer I
wasn't trying the hardest defenses we're
up by so much but I still got split
you
[Music]
the entire arena erupted everyone in
there was going crazy with that happy
bit chilly they'll play after that I'm
trailing behind GT passes in the ball
I like six steps away from the NBA
I know replay pause the yellow line is
the MBA three-pointer could anyone say
curry range real quick that is so far
away dude I don't know how I
I literally have zero clue how that ball
went into the basket but what I made it
everyone went through
and then right after that I tried
scoring three in a row but I just lost
the ball I wanted you to like a step
back I probably could have drove in on
their buddies over dribbles and lost
this was definitely the best our team
ever played together our chemistry was
on point Jane said oh I said with a
pumping he got a bucket everyone was
feeling themselves we were really
feeding off of the crowd crowd started
chanting for mochi
so obviously we had to put moppy in and
we tried to get him a bucket cash found
mobile awfulest movie with the shot
rejected I don't know what he was
thinking I'm not even gonna talk just
listen to the crowd
well mopey I was talking to him after
with everyone chanting his name she just
felt so much pressure on him to make a
basket he literally was just like felt
like the world was like fresh for you to
make like when mochi had the ball
everyone was so tense cuz I won't wanted
him to make it and he wanted to make it
so bad he got it stolen right here and
then they got it done but we've pretty
much song moppy to cherry pick so right
when they scored I drowned the rebound
and I hurled a foul on mochi
take the layup stop with the
three-pointers you're not gonna make a
three he missed that one to you this was
a pretty cool moment cash had the ball
you know him the most had a little bit
of a beat it's settled now cash bail
Mouse yell but luck water the Buffaloes
hit the three
right here is just some exposure that
says smoke be on him
this isn't a good sign for his ankles oh
my god that was nasty
this was another cool moment one of my
favorite moments from the game James was
diddling down I was in the corner
brother-to-brother connection I was
feeling my threes bang bang bang and
then as you can see this get out the
funniest side use me literally as a goat
but I love you guys that was the best
poster ever I love Brandi I was cutting
based on Zack found but you know I have
to use my signature fade away from that
spot and barely went in though if you
look closely I did some cramping OS I
needed some revenge from earlier in the
game with just shot a three in catcher's
face and this is where the entire arena
erupted psych missed another
three-pointer we were trying to get
mopey a bucket bro keep it right here
he's cherry pickin wide open layup again
well the game is really nearing the
close right now pretty much over
moppy wide open three he breaks it
rebound right back to Moe feet bricks it
rebound right back to moppy and this is
where everything changes he gets fouled
ladies and gentlemen mopey has won free
throw will he get a point
[Applause]
the proudest our iPhone Peep Bo Peep
this is it ladies and gentlemen
this is everything one free throw
[Applause]
the most emotional moment into a history
and the final score was 84 to 68 our
team was just so hot bro we were hitting
threes I literally hit a three like six
feet away from the NBA line like we were
so hot I think we really fed off the
crowd and then they were deciding the
MVP of the game bro I didn't even think
about MVP like I didn't even know I was
up for it but they had Zach Kash
and me
oh boy Zack had 15 did I thought Cass
played absolutely amazing he was killing
it
and then for me these are my stats look
at my reaction I did not remember having
10 assists like I could see 10 rebounds
I have a lot of rebounds here in their
way I had the most points on the team
apparently 10 assists 10 rebounds I
don't think I had a triple-double I
don't know I don't know just
if you went to the event I hope you guys

- Oliver, can you plug the router back in?
I'm trying to track a package.
- Ugh, give me a minute. (Liza): Hey guys?
What's up with the internet?
I can't log on to TaskIt. It's prime gigging hour.
It's right after everyone checks Instagram,
but before they get drunk.
- I thought as an ""elite status"" tasker,
you got your pick of the jobs?
- I told you, TaskIt got bought.
Okay? There's no status of any kind, now.
It's a goddamn free for all!
- Right...
Really?
Nothing about your situation down there?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The oversized bags you're carrying?
- Heh. Dude, you're crazy.
- Liza, when did you get surgery?
And why didn't you tell me so I could ""borrow"" some of your Vicodin?
What? It's not for me, it's for Bark-Paul.
He gets so wound up before meet-and-greets.
- Hmm. - Also for me.
- Why can't I experiment with my look?
I mean, you wear mascara.
- It enhances my beautiful almond-shaped eyes.
It'd be a crime not to wear it.
- Well, last week, two different people
mistook me for a child.
A child. Granted, one of them was at the movies,
and I was not about to turn down that kids' snack tray.
It comes in a racecar! Isn't that cool? - Not really.
- But worse, you know how I signed up for Toothpaste And Orange Juice?
- The worst name for a dating app,
literally two things you should never combine.
- Really? Well, Michael B. Jordan's on it.
And so is Michael C. Jordan.
- Who? - I don't know, but he's hot.
But anyways, I haven't gotten one response on my profile.
Not one! But last night,
I took some new photos wearing these.
And guess what?
Ba-dow! I got a date!
That's right, I'm going on a date later.
Because everyone... Loves...
A woman.
(gasping)
(theme music)
Morning Talk
- So, Liza... Who's this date with?
Show, show!
- Well, his name is Tyler,
and look, he's basically a professional athlete.
There he is wearing a baseball hat.
Oh, and that's him on a motorcycle,
and that's a picture of a pizza.
Oh, it was cheat day.
(Oliver): I dunno...
What happens after the date?
During open house, when Tyler wants to tour upstairs,
but it's much smaller than the pictures online?
- Is everything real estate with you?
- Write what you know.
- Well, he will not be taking that tour.
And even if he does, it'll definitely be in the dark.
Nudity is strictly reserved for lights out.
I was publicly naked for one day, and one day only,
and that was the day I was born.
And I intend to keep it that way.
Okay! So how's my outfit for my date?
He's taking me to Office-topia.
(gasping): What? Office-topia?
- What is Office-topia?
- Um, only the hottest Instagram installation.
There are all these office spaces, and you pretend you work in an office,
and take pictures to post. Ugh!
- And you get to send emails, and faxes,
and every two hours it's somebody's birthday,
and they have cake in the break-room.
- Oh! And I hear that there's
this woman named Karen who just sits there
and complains that the AC is too high.
- This just sounds like somebody's office
where they're scamming you all to come in and do free work.
- Oliver. If it was a scam,
could you take a picture with this gigantic World's Best Boss mug?
(Harlow): It is impossible to get a reservation.
I had a spot, but I had to give it up.
I ordered Bark-Paul the cutest little
three-piece suit to wear from Japan,
but I missed the delivery, like, twice!
Which makes zero sense,
because I've literally just been sitting here
waiting for it.
If I don't get it by today,
they're gonna send it back to Tokyo!
Kay, put the router back in!
- I'm working on it!
(phone chiming)
- Oh, a TaskIt!
Perfect. I'm gonna squeeze in a job right before my date.
A model?
That's amazing.
See, I also put my new look on my TaskIt app.
Everybody loves these things. They open doors.
They're master keys!
- Okay.
- I'm a model! I'm a woman model!
A woman model.
- So, you're all set. Glad you came back.
Modeling For Strangers
- Hi, there. I'm here for the modeling job.
- Ooh! Look at you, you're perfect.
- Perfect? Well...
I don't really believe in labels, but if you must.
- So, you've done this before?
- Modeling? Yeah.
I mean, when you look like this it's like,
""Oh! Please! Stop objectifying me!""
- I'm just waiting on the other model.
When she gets here, you can both get undressed.
There are robes inside you can put on
until we get started!
- Un? Undressed? - What?
It's a life-drawing class, to study the naked human form.
- Wha--
Oh, God.
(electronic music)
(whispering): A lot of nipples!
- Oliver? What is this?
Oh, my God, did you...
photoshop our faces onto a wedding picture?
That is so creepy.
I mean, look at that tiara.
What is this, junior prom?
- Well, see...
I met a really hot hubby-chaser
at the market a couple weeks ago.
- Oh, don't say that! I think you look really good!
- Hubby-chaser.
It's a guy who's turned on by straight men on the DL.
Anyway... I may have pretended to be married,
and let him lure me out of the closet.
I thought it was gonna be a one-time thing,
but we're kinda vibing.
We went out last week, I made him meet me in Pasadena
so no one from ""my church"" would see us.
But then I caught him checking out a man
who was walking with his wife, and now he won't text me back.
- Because you're not straight enough?
- Exactly!
So I'm leveling up.
He's gonna come over here, and see exactly
how goddamn straight I am!
- Oh...
- I mean... (clears throat)
- Wait, today?
Oliver, no, I have to wait here
all day for my delivery.
They didn't knock while I was in the shower, did they?
- Oh, shoot, that's right.
Well, since you're gonna be here anyway...
- You knew that I couldn't leave
so you invited him over
for me to be your fake wife, didn't you?
- What? He's an I.T. guy,
and he's coming over here to fix the router.
That way you can get online and track down Bark-Paul's suit.
- Is the router even broken?
- Of course it is.
You don't have a pair of mom jeans, do you?
- Ugh, you know I have several. They accentuate my small waist.
(electronic music)
- You can do this. They're just gonna draw you.
Like a bowl of fruit.
And I'm a flat piece of fruit.
Come on, come on. The teacher said you were perfect.
- Sorry I'm late. - Whoa!
Hey, you might be new here too,
but there are robes.
- We're just gonna take 'em off right?
- Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
Good points.
Boobs. Points. Nipples. I'm sorry.
(art teacher): Okay, can I see the models, please?
Can we see the other model?
- Yup! I'll be right there!
With no clothes on!
In front of all these strangers,
to observe my every... my every flaw.
In one...
Two... Two and a half.
Who am I kidding, I'm not gonna do this.
Maybe start without me!
Oh, what the...? This isn't the dressing room.
Oh no. No, no, no, no!
I can't walk around front in this tiny robe!
Oh please let me walk around front in this tiny robe...
Making Things Worse
Hello? Anyone?!
I know you're all staring at a perfectly proportioned naked woman,
but... hello?!
I guess I'm just gonna have to die here.
They're just gonna find my tiny skeleton in a robe.
My date! Tyler! Office-topia!
Okay.
Just have to make it over there without anybody seeing me.
Like a naked Banksy...
(electronic dance music)
Here, let me help you with that! - Whoa!
- I've got it. You can stay there.
It's a new service from the post office.
Hand delivery.
No more waiting in line at the... mailbox.
You have a good day, now!
Huh...
Not bad.
(flies buzzing) This could be my new look.
Did someone pee on this? Is that blood?
It's all the fluids!
- Oh! You look adorable in this.
- Oh! Thanks!
I was just walking by with all my clothes on and thought,
""Oh, I have to try that coat on."" So I did.
(chuckling) - Good!
You know actually, I have a ton like this inside. Come see!
- Inside? Of course. 'Cause you're a store.
You're not just giving away coats out here. Are you?
(knocking, Oliver clears throat)
- Hello, there. - Hello yourself.
(in a deep voice): Honey!
The guy's here to fix the router!
The guy I've never met before.
- So, uh...
This is where you live? With your wife?
- Shh! I can't get caught.
- There you are, my chocolate love!
My husband.
(forced laughter)
Oh! I didn't even realize there was anyone else here!
I never do when Mr. Right is in the room.
Isn't he just the most handsome groom you've ever seen?
Because we're married. To each other.
- Yup, we are married.
- Uh, and we have so much heterosexual sex!
Sex, sex, sex! Ooh!
He can't keep his hands off me!
So much boning.
- Okay, would you excuse us for a second?
What are you doing? I'm supposed to be
in an unhappy marriage, no sex!
That's why I stray!
- Oh, no, no, no, no. You stray because you're gay.
Not because I don't satisfy you. I'm all satisfaction, honey.
- Also, ""chocolate love""?
- You thought it was so adorable
when I called you that in our wedding toast!
- There was no wedding toast!
- Oh, okay, sure.
Next thing, you're gonna tell me
there was no honeymoon in Bora Bora.
- Wh--
Wait, we went to Bora Bora?
Did we stay in one of those cute over-water bungalows?
No, no! Just go back out there and be more unhappy.
Like a real married couple.
- Fine.
But I'm not spending another Christmas
with your family in Buffalo.
- I'm not even from Buffalo!
(Anna): Yeah, so I can come in tomorrow to get a spray tan.
Yeah, I just feel so pale. Mm-hmm.
(bell chiming) Hey! What are you doing?
- What's that?
Oh, I was just...
Just trying to see this in a more natural light.
Because fluorescence, you know?
- So you weren't trying to leave without paying, were you?
- Oh, I would never!
Wait a second, did you think I was...? With this?
I... Ha! That's hysterical!
No, see, if only you knew how often I pay for stuff.
Which I do. Often.
Well, that's a lovely tan you've got there.
Very, uh... natural?
- Oh, thank you!
People with more color are statistically proven to be more attractive.
It helps us not to procreate with the weak and sickly.
- Right...
Hey, do you have a phone I can use?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.
Slippery.
- So this is where the router is.
Right here. In the closet.
- You like it here in the closet?
- I dunno what you're talking about.
I'm just a married man who needs another hot man to fix his Wi-Fi.
(clattering) - You wanna see what tool I'm gonna use?
(phone ringing)
(Harlow): Oliver! Where are you?
- Just one sec.
Hey. Kind of in the middle of something.
- Great. I need you to go into my room, grab me some clothes,
and come meet me near Office-topia.
- What? Are you crazy? I'm not doing that.
- Can you come and bring me some money then?
Look, I am trapped at a vintage store on third,
with a lady who has a worse fake tan
than all the Real Housewives combined!
- No! No!
- Please? Look, I lost all my clothes and my wallet,
and I've literally been running around Los Angeles naked!
- Oh, good God!
(Harlow): Sweetheart?
- Shh. - Okay, fine,
I'll clean the bathroom for the next month,
and I'll stop eating your chili cashews.
- I knew that was you!
Okay fine, I will meet you by Office-topia,
but if you're not there, I'm leaving your clothes in the nearest trash can.
I'm not waiting for you.
- That's aggressive, but thank you.
Oh!
- Worse than all the Real Housewives?
- I meant that as a... compliment?
I'm so sorry. I'm awful.
And grotesquely pale, but...
Do you could find it in your heart to lend me something to wear?
Anything?
It's brown bag chic!
Dakota Fanning wore the same one!
I don't have paper cuts in my armpits!
Is that... Tyler?
Office-topia.
(rhythmic music)
A Sting In The Tail
- Welcome to Bee Well Bee-Tox, do you have an appointment?
- Huh? Oh, uh... no.
- Oh, that's okay. I think we can squeeze in a walk-in.
Love your dress by the way.
Is this your first time getting Bee-Tox?
Well, welcome to the newest skin care miracle!
All the benefits of botox and fillers with none of the chemicals.
It's just all-natural bee venom.
- You... sting people on the face, with bees?
- No. Not unless you spring for the top of the line Queen Package.
Most people just do the basic injections.
You probably have, hmm... another year
before we have to address the eyes.
But the lip plumping is a ""right now.""
Lauren, if you're having trouble breathing, just give me a nudge.
(Lauren, muffled): Mm-hmm! - Ready? Let's get you lips.
They get you likes.
- Okay. Um, I'm good...
I actually have some bees at home that I can use...
So I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna.
- Careful! - Oh, oh!
(bee buzzing) Oh... I think...
I think one got out.
- No, no. Don't swat it! It's a certified medical aid!
(buzzing)
- It's in here. It's in my bag. It's in my bag!
It's trying to get all up in my hive!
It's in my hive!
This place is a nightmare!
(sobbing)
- Okay, that was a lot more complicated
than I thought. Yeah.
Uh... Do you know when Oliver's coming back?
- Me? (scoffing)
Please. He doesn't tell me anything anymore.
Always sneaking off, saying he's going to the gym.
(sighs): We used to be so happy.
But I'm not giving up.
He's my man, and I will make this marriage work.
- Um... Bark-Paul Gosselaar? You're a fan too?
- Fan? (scoffing)
Honey, he's my dog.
- Shut up! I adore!
- I know, he is pretty adorable, isn't he?
- When you dressed him up like Jonathan Van Ness from Queer Eye,
okay! That was a moment!
- It was, wasn't it!
(giggling) You wanna meet him?
- Are you serious?
- Come on! - Okay!
- Oh. Why yes I would like to learn French.
Merde.
(soft music)
- Hey! Where did you get that?! - What?
- That poster. You need to give it to me.
- Oh, this? Look, I'm so sorry.
It's a really long story, but I kind of really need it right now.
I can hang it back up as soon as I'm done--
- No! I have been all over town tearing those awful things down.
They are extremely offensive.
Have you seen the woman on the cover?
- Yes. What's wrong with her?
- I have spent years starving myself and working out,
and now they're just gonna put someone like that on the cover, huh?!
This has all just been for nothing?
What, now they're just gonna let fat people star in movies,
and do love scenes, and go to the beach in bathing suits?
Without shame?! No! I won't stand for it!
Okay? I don't want a level playing field!
Give it to me! - No!
- It should be me on that cover!
Do you know how many times I've posted about Bikini Tea?
I have to be within five feet of a bathroom at all times.
You can't outrun me. I had breakfast on Tuesday.
Oh!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ooh... I need to find a bathroom.
(upbeat music)
(Liza): Oliver! Oliver!
Over here!
- Miss, you can't stand here.
I could lose my license having a naked person
this close to the fruit.
- Got it.
- Also, you're gonna have to pay for those coconuts
now that they've touched your body.
- Sorry. - I can't believe
how many people are lined up for this crap.
Here.
- Thank you so much.
I'm sorry. I'll just get dressed and get out of your way.
He'll even buy some fruit.
And the coconuts.
- I will not.
Actually, only because you have papaya.
- You would not believe the day I've had.
Oh, my God. You did great with this outfit. I love it.
- I've told you a million times, let me style you!
- New day. I'm here for it. (chuckling)
Okay, I just need to top load.
- For the record, I still think this is wrong.
- Voila! How do I look?
- Like a woman who's lying about her body.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go home and pretend to be
a straight, closeted gay man in a made-up marriage
in order to be more attractive to another gay man.
- Hmm...
Tyler
Tyler?
- Liza? - Hey.
It's so great to meet you in person.
Oh, I... That's just my... that's nothing.
It's just...
Beautiful day, huh?
How did tropical fruit get in my shirt, what?
Okay, Tyler? I have to be honest with you.
I imagine this is less of a surprise the second time.
Look...
I've spent the entire day trying to hide
what I really look like, as if somehow,
something is inherently wrong with me.
And I don't want to waste any more time fighting my hair,
or by body, or my skin,
trying to live up to some arbitrary beauty standard!
I'd much rather spend that time...
...learning French, or helping the homeless, or...
...catching up on Breaking Bad,
because I've never seen it,
and I don't think I can handle
another person saying, ""You've never seen Breaking Bad?""
Please don't say it.
(woman): Seriously? It's amazing!
- So I've heard! Anyway...
What I'm trying to say is...
I'm done, done with hiding...
from the world, but...
more importantly,
from myself.
You know, there is no one else here
who looks exactly like me.
And you know what?
I like that.
I like me.
I'm perfect because I'm not perfect.
(crowd clamoring)
We're all perfect, however God made us!
(cameras clicking)
- Can somebody change the toner in the copy machine?
(commotion)
- I really appreciate your honesty, Liza.
You're brave, and you're inspiring me to be brave too.
I can't see a thing without these.
Sorry, you just got, like super HD right there.
And also...
- I should've seen that coming.
You had a hat on in all your photos.
Hey. I think you look good.
- And I think you're perfect.
- Ah. Perfectly imperfect.
- This feels really right.
Wanna go back to my place and put some clothes on?
- Yeah.
Threesome From Hell
- Oh, yes, yes!
- Are you going to work today?
- Honey. - You're just so cute!
- Sorry it took so long.
- Hi, sir.
Can I talk to you for a sec
about some stuff I found in your system?
- I hope it was nothing bad.
- We need to stop this.
Your wife is a lovely, lovely person,
and she's crazy about you!
I got to know her, and what I realized is
what we're doing, it's wrong.
Yeah, it's unfair. We need to end this lie,
because you owe yourself, and that woman
a little bit of truth.
Plus, I'm 99% sure I broke your router.
I'm not really certified in I.T.
I just took an online course
and then dropped out a day later.
Ha! Sorry!
- Ugh.
- Hey. - Hey, what are you doing home so early?
- Well, Tyler came out about being bald, being blind,
but managed to leave out the part about being married.
- What? - Yeah.
We went back to his place,
and there were pictures of his wife everywhere.
Apparently, she was out of town for the weekend.
- Ugh, that is terrible! Ugh!
How bald? And does he by any chance need help with his internet?
- Don't answer that. Get out of here.
(sighing, scoffing)
- I can't believe you guys didn't photoshop me into your fake wedding.
- Of course I did.
See?
- Are my nostrils really that big?
Jeez, it's like the Grand Canyon.
Nobody look at me, I'm a monster!
(theme music)
? We go to work ?
Yeah, baby.
Oliver, you men are crazy...
(laughing)
? We go to work We go to work ?
? We go to work We go to work ?
It's all the fluids!
Hey!
? Work work work ?
? We go to work work work ?
Blah! What are you gonna do with me?!
I got hair in my mouth, I'm sorry.
- Also, ""chocolate l--"" Oh, mmm, damn it!
I took away your line, and that is what men do. Straight men.
- Strictly nudity. What?
Ah-ha!
- On the next Liza On Demand...
(Liza): Can you believe they're just letting me use this car?
I mean, the glove box is refrigerated.
I went out and I bought butter just for the car.
(Oliver): What's going on?
(Liza): One minute, you're working
in a DNA testing facility,
and you accidentally sneeze in a sample,
and a month later, someone comes to your door
because they think you're related.
- Ah! (laughing)
Mommy's side fought in the civil war.
And for the right side. - Which side is the right side?
- Oh! - Ah!
(laughing) - Your white side owes us this.
- That is some messed up logic. - Let's go!

discord notification
it's mr beast he's doing a hide and seek
contest and the winner
gets a ten thousand dollar refrigerator
i had to have it
but the event was in one hour i needed a
plan and fast
i decided to use one of the oldest
minecraft techniques
camouflage but i couldn't just show up
looking like this what if mr beast had
us all get together to do the intro
everyone would see my disguise
but i had a plan you see minecraft skins
can have a toggleable second layer now
i'd never edited a skin before
but i mean it's just copy paste and how
hard could it be and finally with only
minutes to spare i had done it the only
thing left to do was put on my
masterpiece
don't laugh it's for the fridge okay it
looks a little chubby but so long as
nobody looks at me
too closely wait a second something's a
little off there
shh mr beast explained the rules we were
on a recreation of the planet earth and
us hiders had access to the map you see
now the game began i immediately headed
to the safest place i knew afghanistan
and took off my disguise so this is my
hiding spot right here uh probably not
that clutch
i am wildcat has the right idea he just
went off into the middle of the ocean
he's out of there
while he's falling to his death if i
could direct your attention to the shiny
subscribe button doesn't it look
beautiful don't you just want to press
it
guys please i depend on internet numbers
for validation as i watch the others
techno where you hiding uh yeah i love
antarctica i did a whole
video series in there okay i'm heading
there are you actually in antarctica why
would he lie
techno can you just give me a hint is
anyone in antarctica uh how many fridges
are you willing to pay me for this
information
i'll throw in a five thousand dollar
fridge if you win you mean like an extra
fridge
yeah yo and a five thousand dollar
fridge
yo double fridge yeah there's no one
there there's no one there
okay okay i'm gonna go report this
information to chris except me
i can't believe that people fell off the
side of the earth christopher columbus
was wrong
i think they found chandler chandler is
getting kind of owned right now
while the hunters were busy murdering
chandler i began searching for a better
hiding place i found a hole in the map
and stayed underground for 30 seconds
before an admin kicked me out
then i headed into china where things
took a turn for the worse
oh god they're headed right towards me
hide i give the greatest advice hide
don't
[Music]
what am i hearing right now what am i
hearing
wait wait wait i'm getting nuked i'm
getting
actually new run how are you getting
nuked
i just got actually nuked wait did they
find you i stared mr beast like in the
eyes what did you did you withstand
nukes
you literally got nuked they went
somewhere else
they went somewhere else they literally
nuked you um
they're both flying back they're both
flying back and the admin is staring
right at me
oh wait no way and okay i was in such a
clutch spot
and it was just like all i see is arrows
so i can only imagine what it actually
was
man asia seems to be the place right now
eh i will post your coordinates fundi
uh
spyfee spyfee go away why are all the
hiders coming over to check me out
wait they're actually sabotaging me they
just walked by and placed a boat
why did they place like 20 boats wait
this is actually coordinated scam
i think that small ant wasn't joking bro
puns just placed a boat as well
all right i just realized you guys could
see where me and chris are on your maps
which
makes it kind of easy i don't like that
so here's what we're gonna do chris pick
a random continent asia in five minutes
we're going to just completely delete
asia off the map
good thing i was never hiding there i've
been in canada with fundy the whole time
wow i see mr beast instantly start
flying
towards them also i don't have my boat
anymore my boat will take in a long time
taken taken wow that's someone else
the audacity minutes later they decided
we're just going to cut off the entire
right side of the
map which is not what i wanted to hear
in australia this meant that i would
have to travel across
half the planet all while the hunters
were patrolling looking for people
crossing the new border if i wanted any
chance of getting past them and get in
that refrigerator i needed to go faster
than i ever had before and there was
only one way i was getting that kind of
speed
ice bowden in minecraft rowing across
ice lets you travel at about 90 miles
per hour and there was only one place i
knew
with that much ice i headed to
antarctica
i reached the shores and began gliding
across the ice i just made it clear of
the new border when i saw both hunters
rapidly approaching me on the map
i dived underwater and managed to not
get spotted but when i resurfaced rare
one of them doubled back i think you
missed something down here
well i don't think you've missed
anything actually i think you missed it
wait wait wait wait wait wait no wait
give me give me a second here i wanna i
have a cool
trick that i can show you guys all right
don't pay any attention to my skin
i am playing with honor here i am
playing so basically what i'd like to
say
you'll never catch me alive wait wait
wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait wait wait you'll
never go wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait
i'm trying to negotiate with you get on
top of this stupid boat okay
okay negotiations okay right there we
gotta move into our own private chat
because you know move to recording too
oh god all right
currently two of the ten people have
been found yeah we could kill you right
now
and that would add one to the total true
or true
you could rat out two people and we let
you go are you willing to sacrifice two
people so you stay in
as i looked at the map i saw it filled
with my peers my
friends people i'd known for years did i
really have it in me
to sabotage two of them just for a
measly refrigerator
yes alright so now techno has a prison
cell tell us where two people are
right now or we're gonna kill you oh
yeah there's two of them in eastern
europe just go north and a bit to the
east of here you can't miss them all
right we'll just leave you there
okay i'll just i'll just be stuck in the
salads that's fine
if we find him we'll come get you yeah
well if i don't find them i'm gonna come
kill you
well dude i bet you he's freaking out
right now should i be in this voice chat
still
yeah yeah because you sold him out i
just gave the general location all right
oh i got him i hit it i landed it oh
what have i done
what have i done are we heading the
right direction techno do you want your
freedom
uh we have to kill one more person are
we confident techno couldn't escape from
that prison i'm going to check
yeah we should probably check actually
what
what guys come on come on guys come on
have a little bit of faith but i wait
how'd you get out
guys come on guys guys come on guys guys
please
guys please guys hold on he asked for a
boat
did the boat i give him help him escape
give him a boat for it i was trying to
be nice i killed
i why didn't you tell me you gave him a
boat you nick composed
yes you are you can jump on the boat is
that actually uh i i just jumped and
placed the boat outside and then got in
the boat outside
i just had the prisoners close out the
maps they no longer have it open
i want to let you know that the
prisoners are now going to help me find
a few people
oh no you might want to move to a new
spot oh they're starting to fly
oh god oh you've got to be kidding me
while i hid in the jungles of south
america participants started getting
eliminated left and right
no okay it's far away i can breathe i
need to breathe i need to breathe i need
to breathe okay we're good please tell
me that breathing wasn't my flaw please
tell me that breathing wasn't my flaw
move no eddie just got teleported it got
teleported
oh my god this is so scary oh god
there's a tree burning next to me
there's fire
oh no
armor go go go
my plot armor go go go
i have so many boats get out of there
there were only four participants left
but i had a big problem the border was
slowly shrinking towards america and to
get there i would have to travel across
hundreds of blocks of open field i'd be
visible for miles i waited for the
opportune moment to make a dash for it
but before i could find a good height in
place i saw them
the hunters you hear it two puns yep if
they
if they burn this tree down that's above
me i lose there's no way i don't
yeah same here man same here tree
brother
oh techno you would have been done with
wombcat right there they're all just
scanning the border this is terrifying i
don't know
like the bronx
so is the border just gonna like shrink
non-stop at this point
i don't know why would that affect you
uh significantly no i'm just curious
guys i'm i'm going to be honest i'm
really scared right now i'm not going to
lie
same here there were six people
then the number went up one at one point
dang there's four people
how are we gonna find you so what what
is your guys so what is your plan been
so far chris
bombing the entire
[Music]
okay let's see it just kind of happened
we didn't even know what was happening
to be honest it's just gonna keep
shrinking i mean
if you guys keep being little campy boys
camping and hide-and-seek
couldn't be me i mean i just scanned the
entire top of north america you guys are
clearly hiding underground
oh get them out of here techno
definitely is a tryhard so he probably

ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another video today well we have some puzzle pieces and you know what else we
have we got a giant dice today we're playing a giant game board I did one of
these videos a couple weeks ago you guys loved it it got over 5 million views so um yeah obviously you guys want to see a
part two you guys left a ton of support on that video so we're doing a part two here but we changed it up a lot this is
a lot different from the previous game but it's similar in a way we're gonna have myself playing Gabe oh okay and
James behind the camera let me explain how this game works for those of you guys that don't know it's pretty simple
we're going to roll the dice whenever you land on that's how many spaces you move forward if you land on the yellow
you're safe if you land on the roof same thing happens you're safe you're good if you're letting on the green that is good
very very good you're gonna come over here and you're gonna spin the green mystery wheel this is full of good
things like candy move forward five spaces roll the dice again it's full of
good things however there is one bad thing about this game and that is the red if you land on the red you have to
spin the red mystery wheel which is full of a lot of yeah oh no no no no no no
where this game gets different is we obviously changed up the mystery wheels they're completely different but we also added two different paths you come
around here go downstairs you can see the game splits into two different ways one goes around into the living
really long the other one goes right around to the kitchen straight to the finish right over there by the kitchen
table obviously you would probably say oh I'll pick the shortest way in this case there is black spaces if you land
on one of those black spaces I promise you it is way worse than the landing on a red like it's really bad how bad are
we talking like okay so if you land on the black space you have to draw a piece of paper from this block and speakable
bag that we have there's about eight things in there one of them is you lose the game that's it do you turn on like
you yeah like you're done no no restart no sorry no nothing like you lost oh that is bad but you can make it through
there because between the black spaces is green and red so if you land on the green and red you're safe but if you
land on the black you're properly done now you gets probably curious what does the winner get of this challenge the
loser so the person in the very last place has to buy the winner whatever
they want no limits whatever they want only one thing anything so for this
video I will be the little guitar ukulele whatever you want to call it I'll be this you'll be the matches
you'll be the unspeakable water bottle so these are our pieces that we're gonna put on the game the kind of market and
then where's your toaster how much is that okay James is a toaster all right
Gabe you roll four and I get to spin the
green mystery wheel
[Music] it's a sweet start underestimate the
toaster the toaster move forward five spaces toaster power what are the odds
what do we got what do we got pic player to spin read wheel so you pick either
mean gate to spin the red wheel you spin the red wheel yes the net wheel employee you know what I'm gonna do I just turn
it on your toaster you just turn on my toasted bread again that was terrible is
burning it smells it okay oh he's actually pause he's doing okay okay well
you can't play now so it's your turn good unless we hit him within then move
his piece I mean well I guess we wanted to be nice we could on pause him but I don't down here later this is what we'll
do we got fixes okay we're gonna we're gonna roll for Nathan hey I'm up five
all right moving five I guess one two three Oh
okay so we got to spend the green wheel for unspeakable this is not my turn let's just clarify this hey your pause
I'll stick it in bling okay move to the
next screen space and spin again oh he's not even playing and he's beating up
till Nathan's turn by the way it still makes me turn we're for the plain form choose up on it to move back five spaces
well hey Chuck can't choose Oh Jim's okay Oh back five lineup oh I appreciate hey
Nathan hey what's up to there ukulele needs to go back to mine I've only
rolled the dice but it's right here I hear we got it we got to make you bout
time oh wait no I'm after Nathan but some do be skipping oh yeah yes family all right go okay what are you doing sir
your paws we did not start a timer it is me that's already been five minutes oh you're counting in your head
wow that was quick Wow that came from all the way downstairs no.5 is this what I think it
is it's exactly what you think it is
spin the wheel 2 times 2 times 1 ok ok we're gonna spin again one more
time let's see 1 2 3 4 ok we're down fake Nathan for this one we're gonna put
him right here that's 5 and I rich go again that's a 1 you have a 1 sir we're
good alright Athens turn he was on that
Corina gangnam-gu bed no what am I gonna be on post well we're
not counting so just whenever you like it I guess yeah watch it's gonna be like
this during back 5 spaces or something hey back up my personal space I did my
paws can I at least eat Miami buddy you
know it's funny cuz he almost why why
why do you why you god dude it what my god
if I get for 10 minutes terrible oh my
gosh you're so close it without blow dart gun what kind of blow dart gun Gabe we're
gonna have to wait till your own paused for that come I won't forget it I can't hit myself why not
Dennis you guys are poised I'm about to be on pause because I meant nine minutes and thirty seconds right now alright
here we go again my Nathan's turn three all right okay
okay alright guys just stay still
alright I'm finally imposed Gabe you got another eight minutes something like
that I'm gonna take good care of you this is Gabe's role not mine cuz these paws
spin the wheel two times oh my gosh Gabe stop this just cuz I'm Stan for you move to the
next green space and spin again okay so
now you get to other spins so here's one at the total force then choose the
opponent to move back five spaces so choose someone to move back by space well you're giving me pretty good luck now so James come on that poster Batman
testing one two three four five get one
more spin do I have everyone so lucky when their paws move forward five
yellow you're saying yeah you're wrong what are you only playing on the six
yeah back or one space behind yeah cuz I was on the red I'm just trying to charge
you up it's okay little scared for a
second right here it's her turn now I gotta roll my dice we should be kidding it really is in the way I know six one
two three four five six for each other all right so now the babes roll I'm
gonna roll her game that was gonna get a 5 there first is oh goodness I'm safe on
the blue side ironic home 5 James you
need a 5 wait why do you say that gave a
suitor number you blew your honor blue
that would be a 3 1 2 3 are holes on the green no master no hots your turn sir
I thought you're saying green for you
that we're spending the green we'll [Music] switch places with the person in front
of you while there's no one in front of you because you're in first place so you laugh darn it knows I just don't get any
benefit yeah you'd get no but it's just no it's just like a Blue Square red that yellow yeah we're a gave up catch in Oh
1 2 3 I'll land right on the green pick
player to spend the red wheel no gate i'ma spin the red field for you is that ok
so I've got the red wheel this is all you I guess it's too late that's all you so both of you guys get
to get hit with a blow dart gun two two and a half hour minutes literally just
one you oh yeah my turn
you're safe almost on the red gave is your spin give me my dice what do you
mean about ten minutes yes let's you're
gonna have to grab that blow dart real quick so we have built this blow dart gun out of a pipe and it shoots these
nerf bullets that are fully hard plastic Gabe can you give us a quick demonstration so we haven't a half inch
inner diameter PVC and we have a substitute thing and it just this dart
right here is like solid plastic give us a quick demonstration shoot at the wall that's got hurt all right James
line up hi the leg the toe go let's go
let's go let's go leg okay oh my leg right on the leg okay ready just
remember you gotta get shot by this I know full power game I'm gonna give it full power go and he's shooting it stinks

but we need to stay right all right
let's get back to the game boys my turn gave them catching up to you oh my go you ain't going to your roll one land on

safe yeah all right I'm gonna go behind me what you're safe you safe
all right now normally this would be game Stern however lost sister so it's
my turn Wow one two three come on that's too bad
I can deal with that switch places with the person behind you there's not a lot
on this one kiss place with the person behind you but there is no one behind me I guess that was his role
[Applause] you wanna kiss me well you see here in this wild country
the toaster attacked the water bottle and when a toaster attacks of water bottle normally toasters are very warm
water ball is very cold so they're not really an axe very well and James is spinning the red roll right now where do you land on why do you keep landing on
them all right so I'm gonna pick up James here and now that's what my turn
[Music]
green will give me something good switch
places with the person in front of you why do I always land on that and I don't need it no red spots
he just loves gonna go at once doesn't he okay now we're moving downstairs
we're really you know no longer up sir I mean I got halfway to know we're down said yeah we're done okay so it's my
turn go nah
okay so Gabe now you need to think about this for a little bit which way do you want to go I mean this is black green
black red black green red black but if
you choose this way look you make it that's the finish line right there if you go this way look how long this other
way is this is even longer than going all through the upstairs but this is a 50/50 chance yeah I can't see my list so
just just think about it you know something we all gotta think about which path we're gonna go are you counting the spaces how many spaces is 17 spaces
going this way 53 spaces if you go this way
on another green I'm not complaining
shus opponent to move back five spaces well Gabe place right now so I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave nope that's not how that Gabe come on I
landed on a green so I get you if you spin and land on me forward folks I will
be a happy man switch places with the
person in front of you when I start you
know you're right I don't like this I don't like I don't like this we both live it on green how are you gonna know
which are you mad yeah because watch at
the very end of the game remember if you lose and I win you gotta buy me something easier why I really want to
Lambeau this is exactly what happened last kiss

that good three what I would consider
that say no that not I'm happy I'm happy bro you imagine you've made it a quarter of the way if I go back five spaces can
I change my path yeah pour five gallons of water on your head
there's a lot of water I hope you don't drown
[Music] all right so games filling up the water and James what did you find back there I
don't think you understand the importance and legendary legendary Ness of that flower back there what is it bro

efforts just for me yeah of it it's really hot I wish I had some water I wish I had some water
- our guy goodbye Jeff good guy there it
is and you're good all right all right okay I'm not even mad this this should have
been a green all right well now it's my
turn I have to make my decision
oh gosh three count you can't be bribed
land on black compromised he can take this route but he has to reroll any to
take this no matter what we are not
making that deal listen listen take this rock take this route you know why I say take this road because if you take this
route and gave wins and the next three turns you're in last place know you've
been one no because in three turns I'm taking this rope oh you're going that way maybe I'm going this way one two
three four five six I am NOT going that dangerous way but
you're gonna lose and have to pay for whatever we want we'll see about that move forward my gosh why did I say
something why did I say something this is just karma just carbon you still didn't lose them I want a
Ferrari yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna get a Ferrari after this so let me call you back on a win hi to again
you got a - hey that's not bad oh okay you met everybody was a chocolate roll
again roll the dice again like it's gonna matter oh they're wasted are you serious dude
just boiling it on another green every
time I say something's gonna happen
we're watching land on a 1 again wait oh
you know that reference really comment and literally Pettit the teacher he's done that what five times you have said
something in Luther's right after you say it actually happens all you mystery okay yeah most thing be careful with
that magic you got going on in there let the magic be free do what you want
[Applause] Wow
very good look the only green there are no and explain oh I'm getting too cocky
that means I lose move to the next green space and this can actually kind of be
bad listening it's green how can it be bad I don't know there's no there's no
more green space yeah oh there's no green but I guess and whatever you want
afterwards right I could land on the one
but I mean this is what happened last time I was about to win and he like switches but that's a green oh yeah I
could touch this pick a player to spend the red wheel well I mean you I mean you
didn't even think about it you're in first place three spaces away from I'm gonna say anything cuz you know that goes when I say something so lego shoes
there alright here let me get them for you some nice fresh kicks slide them on this
slide I don't think it's gonna fit I got some big toes and I have to adjust the
sizing for you I got some big toes even one size fits all get that baby in there
bro yeah I feel like a gazelle alright
is James's turn one two three four five
six more of these black spaces I'm cool
with that I'm cool five water balloons oh man he's alright he's already ready
alright come on game you got this holy
me we don't accept bullying thrown into
a dress
all right walk well waterboy no how are you sir you know you got enjoyed your
Walker punishments I did not we all got water punishments I hate you guys this could be could be game so if I
land on o1 that's a black and that pretty much means the game but if you
land on two or three you're good but you can't roll like anything more than three
right this is the any piece you can't
cuz there's no more pieces it's just like sorry bro sorry three because you
have to land on the finish that's how you win making the sorry a long long time yeah remember we're like
years old no more one James is here to
turn six one two three four five there
you go buddy there's a bunch of pieces of paper in this bag up that's just a business card
I pulled out a car yeah not that pocket it's a big one no no no hey whoa whoa
he's stuck what do you got open up Oh go sit in the corner and count to a
thousand all other players continue playing that's a big number Calvin fi James go count to a thousand
should take you only about 17 minutes
okay so he's gonna keep counting it's your turn - oh my gosh you're safe
you're good news roll one let's finish
this game all game has to do is roll a 1
James that's the finish counting to a thousand and then you can get back get back in the game and then I am yeah I'm
pretty far away
wrote that twice roll along don't roll away that was close you're at 300 bro you'll
be back in the game soon he's going fast to the red and landed on red red move 5
spaces you serious ok
okay well I'm on the yellow oh that's beautiful oh oh come on
Oh am i he's getting that whenever you
switch places with the person in front of you no no no
[Applause]
what do you doing doing this to me your entire race why did I get to spin
the green since my green are we doing that we never did it on switches you're right yeah you haven't done that which
is the way with the way we dinosaurs switch spaces we don't have them spin but if you move back or forward five
space run if you land on a green or red what so now I need definitely more than a one yeah you definitely need more than
a one now III need the one don't do it
don't do it don't do it one two three
James what are you at 7-eleven you said free candy I don't need candy at a time
like this but I'll take James how you doing how many times have you counted
200 I mean I never I just council 1 1 through 15 then I start over again and I just keep track of my fingers
that's you candy what once you you know James all I have to do is roll one and I
win you want if you just say I won't roll a one stop same things we all know how that goes oh well three
oh one two right on the red I do not
want a tongue I'll tell you what it is okay switch places with the person behind you okay that's not bad because
there's no one behind you oh you want me to count oak oh okay so
let's let's count the spaces we're gonna see who is farther away no James yeah
[Applause] hey James are you gone James James
hey wait why are you leaving - but why is it really hey wait you you gotta buy me you gotta
buy me - stop I'll flip alright so I am the winner and gave here is a loser Oh
Gabe you have to buy me whatever I want you ready to go to the store he doesn't look too happy
he doesn't look - yeah the thing is I could see his frustration because he was one space away from winning one space
away from winning and I land on the green and I land so which places for the person in front of you he sounds gonna

mental talking about a guy who hurt you
in the alley in the alleyway
behind
behind Okay so you got hurt in the alley
behind the seil I owed him nothing oh my
my God he going to pause this cuz he's
showing me what happened to him I think
it was in the behind the sea in like an
Alleyway a man that was just like
desperate I heard him say like mental
which is like I think he was trying to
insult this man this man was super
aggressive like I think he was robbed or
something was taken from him and maybe
stabbed I think he died behind the sea
wow the fire alarm when no one was
living in the sea and the fire alarms
just went off one night and it was going
off for like 6 hours or something just
because no one start turned off um and
the next day I had a friend come over
and I was like isn't it like I feel
weird to like even talk about the seil
and like what happens to cuz I feel like
the ghosts are watching me and right
when I said that the fire alarm in just
my apartment unit went off and we like
went outside cuz we thought it was the
whole building and it was just mine yeah
I just come back from my last wanted
house in Iowa it was the next night I
came back and that's what happen I may I
brought something back could have
followed you did you feel like negative
for a while or anything like that oh yes
because that trip my all my yes all myps
my whole footage um from the entire trip
the hard dag corrupted not only the hard
drive but um both SD cards from two
different cameras everything and so then
I end up having to pay like6 or 7,000 to
get the footage back and I
some
some some as you're talking my throat's
starting to get super tight I don't it's
like I'm try I'm see I can't even speak
I'll having trouble speaking because of
it does that happen sometimes it happens
when there's a more negative presence I
don't know what this is and like you're
be talking about it I don't
know I think so I got does that mean
it's nearby does that mean it's just
hanging around it was right you have to
put your hand there to do
that should we see who this is yeah if
this is an attachment because this I
don't know what this is it's definitely
more of a negative presence it doesn't
necessarily mean it's demonic but it's a
lot stronger oh I just saw
it okay I'm ready so it's here it's here
are you upset that we're
here
no no what is is happening are you
attached to Pete never
left are you scared that we'll take you
away from
Pete someone just screamed in my ear I'm

jeffreestar,"15,800,000","2,585,704,524",433,Howto & Style,2006,"what's up everybody welcome back to my channel!l today we're taking out the trash!
alright so you guys saw the title you saw the thumbnail... crickets please now
I've been getting a lot of requests since I've started my youtube channel to use makeup I don't like now this started out as the
concept of just cleaning out my Beauty room so I have done a lot of giving away lately I get so much PR so much free makeup I buy a lot of makeup a lot of it
is about to expire it already has there's just a lot of junk laying around... like I know I've never done a Beauty room tour which will come later this
year I think I promise I hope... I have like three Beauty rooms okay now I have makeup from ten years ago in drawers I'm talking like old Mac lipsticks when I
used to work there like in the vault I have stuff I haven't seen in forever so
I started to just clean my Beauty room and then I donated a lot of PR to a lot of women's shelters in Los Angeles a lot of my friends a lot of people in need
that just need makeup I started there and then I went into like the vault and I went there stuff that I really wasn't feeling anymore so in today's video
you're gonna see stuff from maybe old friends maybe old brands I used to live for and brand owners have degraded me we were gonna see products of brands I just
really don't care about anymore that aren't interesting and just some products that I've tried on my channel and they just didn't work for me so
today is not about drama it's about telling the truth and trying out stuff maybe giving it a second try before it goes in the trash now if something is
expired you should throw in the trash I get a lot of people like will give it to me girl and on my garage the foundation has expired I don't want to give it to
anyone that I like girl stop so if you did not know this on every single item of makeup including my own you legally have to put this little icon jar here
let's grab something that I actually like Urban Decay all nighter spray so on every single thing we're gonna zoom in here with the lens it has this tiny
little jar as a consumer you may not notice that or you may go I don't ever even knew what that was this is called the period after opening so after you
open up a product this is how long that it is allegedly allowed to be used for so let's even grab something of mine or even a
this is a guy literally just using or being a pallet the other day so if you go here the jar says 18 months on the shadow so every item it's kind of like a
suggestion now to me a lot of stuff like powders don't really go bad as fast as
like Kramer's and Foundation so anyway we're getting some stuff that is about to expire if you have a lot of stuff in your collection that is expired it's
okay but if it looks a little discolored if it smells weird throw it away girl so without further adieu God let's say sign the prayer let's dive into this video
all right let's start off with a bang and now I used to actually live for this primer this is the Too Faced hangover replenishing a face primer now a lot of
you are probably bled hmm what do you mean Geoffrey we don't really ever see use toothpaste on this channel well that's because I don't ever review or
use two-faced on my channel anymore I used to actually live for their brand yes in collaboration with Too Faced which has been one of my favorite brands
for the last ten years just so you know but last year I defended tart with a
little makeup scandal video oh this looks kind of nasty can we zoom in on that Jesus Christ I'm like as mine cursed looks a little too yellowy this
is definitely expiring Imus I'm afraid to put this on my face but here goes nothing so if you guys did not know someone named Jared used to be the owner
of two-faced he sold his brand to Estee Lauder now last year he and his sister
said some horrible things about me because he was degrading the brand tart and I'm like honey you did not invent unicorns I know you think you do and
you're very entitled and you think that you run the world you don't come back to earth so it started a huge social media fiasco if
you will I'm gonna show some screenshots all over the screen in a minute and Jared the old owner but still creative director of the brand really went in on
me and him and his sister who I don't know if she has anything to do with the brand or if she just uses him for money but she said that my brand was clown
makeup okay and they said a lot of other horrible things about me now Estee
Lauder had to ask them to shut up which I don't know if that was ever told on record and they finally left me alone I'm sure after this video they're gonna
probably continue to degrade me but actually they used to love two-faced and I was a huge fan in high school I was wearing
their stuff in 12th grade and it's just crazy when you can become a competitor
and someone big on social media where in turn years later when you know one of
your favorite brands doesn't like you or they say horrible things about you so welcome to social media first of all this primer is on this is all right
actually still love this formula so I'm not shading the formula at all but it just sucks that people that are literally almost twice my age are
degrading me so that's the T on that you will never see me review anything of Too
Faced on my channel I don't like to support people that are evil or really nasty so there's the T alright the next item we're gonna use let's go to
foundation and now we all know about this fiasco Tarte don't love them don't
hate them they've been a consistent brand that I've kind of liked throughout the years but when they're shaped a foundation range hit the Internet
well gasped and threw up we all know that most brands create more than two
shades for women of color but turn decided to say fuck it and I think what made this worse now I did review this these shades looks so light oh my god
girl I've been getting a kind of a tan lately but maybe not okay well we're just gonna go in and try it now I did do a review and talked about this
foundation I'll put that up right here if you did not know I will show the foundation range in a second but the thing that made it worse was the news
article of interviewing tart and then saying some very weird stuff like oh
well you know this foundation you know we don't have that many shades because it's like we know you can use some for the winter and then you can transition
into your summer shade it was like this weird lame excuse that really never made sense to me and he didn't really get it but it caused a big stir because their
lack of shade range was embarrassing it wasn't just like it was like you know they kind of fucked up it was like girl they fucked up so I really wasn't living
for that this formula by the way is not the greatest or concealer though we all know is a classic but the foundation was kind of like for me and since I reviewed
it it's been sitting in the drawer forgot about it don't care about it and it's time it goes in the trash all right now
this one even actually isn't that bad I've tried a lot of better ones the last year but um memory lane also if you are such a big brand with a really big
budget we need brands to start making a more foundation Shea it's like girl at this stage in the game anyone can do it and if you're not doing at this stage
you're basically just kind of saying like fuck you to a huge group of people so any brand from here on out that doesn't make a lot of shades this
actually counts a little I'm out a little bit more I don't know I just can't relate you guys when I make my foundation and it comes out next year
well I am working on right now but when it comes out next year there ain't gonna be 12 shade they'll tell you that now moving on not everything has a story
here you guys I will say that but okay concealer now this you guys know I love
Chanel so you're probably like what are you so what is he gonna say Chanel does not have a concealer shade light enough for me this is shade 10 their lightest
one and a corrector perfection and I've had this for a while you can see it's kind of separating in there hmm little chemically not too crazy first of all
let's just show you guys the T here doesn't look that bad on camera but it's very orange like this is actually darker than my skin tone I don't know if you
can see that on the camera of how its reading but like see how it just kind of blends into its like I'm not really doing much so I never really lived for
this concealer I think I used it once or twice it's sat in the drawer it's about to expire or it's actually been expired for months so hopefully I don't get a
chemical burn ah no I love Chanel beauty by the way you know that Chanel beauty is in Ulta now I'm like shook about that Sephora is like hi we're doing color pop
and alt does like green we're doing white in a wild chanel and everything else have a seat which one do you guys prefer do you love Ulta more do you love
Sephora do you love that they're both kind of like really mixing their roster of brands and they're kind of like going all over the place what do you guys feel
about that alright concealer you were never good to me okay moving on setting
powder now I was a little iffy about this but I'm like you know what who with a big platform is gonna speak out on this
really no one has there's a lot of smaller influencers that have touched on this subject hooda beauty has completely ignored
everything that people have been saying so you know what I'm sorry I gotta bring it up now y'all know I love you a lot of hooded beauty products I have reviewed
her foundation helped us sell a lot of them you know that's the taeho I've used a lot of her stuff on my face on this channel and overall it's been a very
consistent brand but this product came out what is this called
this is the easy-bake loose baking and setting powder now I'm all for people being inspired by other brands but when you literally steal the exact concept
and photo shoot from a indie brand how do you sleep at night
that's the realty how do you sleep at night so I'm gonna use this right now on camera and I really don't want to but we're gonna do it anyway that's what
we're all about is full face of makeup we're throwing out now what is the tea on this you may say Geoffrey I don't even know what you're talking about well
let's throw up a few images there is a indie brand that we have used on this channel I've actually reviewed it that is called a beauty bakery it is a
black-owned brand from a beautiful woman that actually survived cancer she
started her makeup brand and she is really flourishing but she is still a very small company and they are very indie compared to the giant of hooda
Beauty this ad campaign and the entire collection was revealed online in every single comment i'm trying-- mood and on everyone's pages was like you literally
stole her concept hooda has really never acknowledged it she's just keep it moving making her money I don't like that
now Beauty bakery if you have not heard of them have been out since 2011 their packaging looks like this everything is about baking and cake and it's their
full aesthetic I mean hi are you guys kidding me right here so everything is all about cake baking mixing this actually came in a litter a literal
flower like you're in the kitchen making like cookies with flowers so the entire
packaging idea was stolen and I don't understand why a bit of beauty is all
about like being in the desert and sand and all this crazy stuff and her culture why are you stealing someone else's whole entire concept and the fact that
she's never really acknowledged it really bothers me I she's just gonna think that whatever people won't care in a month and we'll
make all of our money so that kind of sucks oh wow I mean the formulas actually not that bad bitch that's actually pretty sad because I would love
to support this collection but if you were gonna steal from people and not acknowledge it can't relate all right so let's contour this face first item BAM
this is the benefit hoola quickie contour stick now you guys know I love benefit I was even in their ad campaigns last summer in Sephora every time that
I've tried to use this product and all of my friends who have used this we have a little issue here we go to use it and it's like oh what happened girl the
formula the packaging something happened in QC and it just flopped I don't know what happened but every single person I've seen use this
the stick has fallen out I hate that it sucks I'm so sorry benefit it happens sometimes you guys you know there's so many products being made
sometimes should happen so I'm not like hating benefit at all but I really I
don't even think I minded the formula it's just the falling out girl come on
what happened there I don't even remember if this fountain if this blends out good I'm scared now I'm like oh fuck oh looks like a little piece of Dookie
all right we're gonna put this right back in here and then let's try to blend this out
with the Beautyblender it softens a lot remember it is a cream product so that looks over way better than when that brush just attempted oh my god looks
like I got punched remember to review that doer stuff last week that is probably the worst my contours ever loved thank God I'm not going outside
after this because this is horrifying Jesus I'm like that product must be expiring soon because I don't remember being this hard to blend well Chris here
just said you didn't do the forehead on your contour well we're about to so um
alright benefit this didn't blend out that bad I literally took this and was like dragging it so I didn't look to fill Chris should I do the forehead no
I'm scared just formula though right for this ooh my hair surgery is shaking okay so why did I just do this to myself well should we just take this and cry hi just
rub some dirt from my yard on my forehead how are you doing okay
BAM that bad huh alright let's move on alright now the next product girl let's
just hold it up BAM this is the Kat Von D what was this call this Sh is so old
this is the shady bronzer fitting and it says don't be afraid to contour the fuck
out of your face alright now this is probably like eight years old I want to
say this was like in the deep hitting drawers of my makeup room that I have not touched in a long time now if you are someone that has newly subscribed to
me or you don't know the Realty girl just google my name and this person's name now before any of you try to chime in or if anyone is here that is on a Kat
Von D fan let me just remind you one thing I was her friend for 10 years you've never met her so do I know the realty of course I do
if you do not know the scenario basically two summers ago my brand was skyrocketing Kat Bundy was stagnant and she decided to cross out my face and let
the internet know a bunch of crazy lies of course I responded and debunked everything that she said because she was completely full of shit and there's
always just been a weird tension ever since now we're talking ten years of friendship and in that 10 years a lot happened what a lot of you been waiting
for me to say anything but I just kind of move along when I process someone kind of like a death I don't really ever talk about them again
but a funny fact when all that happened I remember her saying one thing she
basically said that her lipstick which by the way was a top seller in Sephora called Jeffrey of course with my spelling she named a lipstick after me
years ago and it has literally been on sale every single day up until about two
weeks ago so even after our fight imagine Sephora who is of course
affiliated with kendo which is a company that owns her brand they denied her request and they sold her Jeffrey lipstick up until about a month
ago on Sephora calm so the fact that you have a face of a brand and your name is
on the package name you couldn't even tell them and get my shade taken down can't relate I own my own company the reason why I'm mentioning this and by
the way this is a great formula at the time I always supported her dreams and when she created her makeup line a long time ago I always support it and gave it
attention now you can see this is a long time ago this came out and of course we hit pan on this cuz I lived for this formula this is before the shade and
light craze that hit so I still I haven't oh my god it's all like this is so weird to be this is like a very bizarre moment so a lot of you are going
okay is there any more tea of course there is so I was scrolling and on my sidebar the other day there was a drama channel that covered something and it
was like Kat Von D came for Jeffrey star and I'm like you recently got married I
guess you're pregnant you're all these things are happening and you're still concerned with me you're still concerned with me you're still concerned with me I
don't understand so let's throw up the screenshot I guess she just uploaded a video on her wedding let me let me go click this right now the drama channel
basically showed me a screenshot where someone on her wedding video which this
is like you're a special day honey asked I bet you Jeffery star is at home watching this I'm actually not baby I'm busy running a multi-million dollar
company or maybe five companies and I'm a little busy over here filming and just you know living my life but someone wrote I get Jeffrey star is probably at
home watching this or something like that I'll throw up a screenshot right now and she this thing had to write Jeffrey who with a wink and I'm like
that's all you can say free who how about Jeffrey that had the lipstick in Sephora with my motherfucking name on it with your
company for the last 10 years how about Jeffrey that's in all your books all your memories like girl because she was always a friend they had
the nicer stuff and the role is reversed my father looks like dirt actual dirt so
anyway I don't know why she's full talking about me so I thought you know what let me just respond so I could stop getting a million tweets about it cuz it
does get really old it's like a constant reminder it's like an open wound it's like oh you're done Oh someone else to mention this person again so I'm like
Jeffrey who all right so while editing this video I discovered some information
that was very interesting to me now if we all remember in Kat Von D's a video
about me she said that she would sadly be removing the jeffrey liquid lip from
sephora and her website well we just logged on to Kat Von D Beauty comm which
is her personal website where she ships products from aside from the Sephora and you can click right now and still buy the Jeffrey lipstick so it's crazy that
you can click it right now and buy it there were so many lies in her video it's crazy how another one is debunked and it's just so crazy that right now
2018 you're seeing Jeffery who but the Jeffery liquid lip is on your website so what's what's good sis that's all you
gotta say that is the most like on creative response or clap back or
anything that I've ever heard in my life so this is the last remaining product I have of hers and now it's over next also by the way you guys don't ever go and
send anyone any hate this is just my personal feelings of course I when you're friend to someone for that long and they want to chime in about you all
of a sudden it's like can't relate alright so I'm moving on oh the second foundation powder in my
water cup love that all right now for highlight we're gonna bring back this old ditty now I review this a while ago of my channel this is a ninety five
dollar highlighter from the brand that clay to PO they're very luxury bushi obviously the packaging looks beautiful but then let's
get to the inside Wow now this does look stunning but as we found out in my
review this little glitter moment here is an overspray so once you wipe that off it's literally chalk underneath and I'm
like for $95 this is what we get like let's put it on my hand high it evaporated wig I promise I went really hard in that pan making this up hello I
don't see anything nope nothing's happening mm-hmm look at that fallout
though now girl fuck looks like a meth lab yeah for $95 I expected it to be beautiful and blinding and all I got was some chalk and not even the kind of
chalk that I can like draw on my driveway just straight-up chalk alright BAM for blush we're gonna go in with this Kylie cosmetics shade x-rated
now let me tell you guys why for a second I am putting this in the trash this one just really didn't have a lot of pigment like do you guys remember
when these first launch and amend the highlighters the Heather's were all right they're a little lackluster but on this I was kind of like first of
all the fallout is really crazy I was like barely touching man it's like whoa Lord now when you put this on your cheeks I expect like way more color it's
so sure I'm like Hello what's going on like excuse me we're gonna do more
pigment okay so to me this blush was just not it for me I also have another Kylie product I want to put in here and I'll go into a little further detail in
a minute but this just didn't have any pigment and I'm bored all right now let's go on to eyes now I'm sure what have you saw this in the thumbnail and
you're like oh my god it's not as dramatic as you think so we are going to be using the Oh any more feet Jaclyn hill vault now by
the way this PR is one of the best PR packages I've gotten in a long time I think that it looks stunning now the only reason why this is even in the
video is because morphe said that they are of course delaying the morphe Jacqueline Hill vault collection because there was some inconsistencies in the
formula and some people who are reviewing it and it was like amazing and then other people were reviewing it and it was just like kind of lackluster and
not great so morphe did some investigating and they actually found out that the lab did press it inconsistently so this is not a negative
I'm actually like so I guess what's what's the word I'm very like happy that
Jacqueline and morphe agreed to do this because for a company to stop a launch and move it and throw away all the product is a lot of money lost
so I really appreciate Jacqueline taking the time to be like yo this is not like good this is not okay with me selling this let's make sure it's perfect and
have it come out later so no T in this video honey I just actually never use these myself as you can see there's not even a swatch on here I was at a town
when these launched so when I came home I saw them and then all the um I guess it's not controversy it's just all their statements came out and people were
finding some inconsistencies so I personally never used these I can't wait if mine is a dud and it looks a little weird you guys know why it's not more if
you're at Jacqueline's fault but I am just gonna try out a few shades just for fun to see what the tea is all about of course let's just quickly prime I don't
have any primer that I want to throw out isn't that weird for eye primer I always know you guys know I'm always using this Mac painterly paint-pot
so let's just coat our lids and get the show on the road okay actually these colors are stunning I'm just sitting here like girl the shade
access is such a unique like orange yellow tangerine moment I'm like girl
now remember the first jaclyn hill morphe palette was in one of my favorites videos last year I really like that one it is stunning now I heard that
of course these shades are from all the ones that she did not use in her initial palette which I love that idea so I cannot wait for them to release the real
vault to me Jacqueline's always done like amazing collab doing hi a champagne pop like literally revolutionized the highlighting game and that's when the
trend really started so Jacqueline is always gross she knows what the tea is regardless that your thoughts are on her her claps have been amazing and you know
she is one of the original beauty gurus on YouTube so respect alright now we're
gonna go on with this shade agent over here now this one when I spread it out it wasn't too bad I see maybe where the pressing was a little
weird but overall I'm not mad I'm not missing the second shade I'm dipping into I'm just gonna do a little light look and try out a few colors alright
now we're gonna go in shade guilt-trip right here I didn't wet the brush yet oh wow okay this was definitely impressed too hard I think there's no pigment on
the brush I'm like oh okay we're gonna wet this by the way who is waiting for
Jaclyn hill cosmetics honey we're all waiting what's the tea give us an update okay it's not too bad alright so in case you guys did not know of course just a
quick little morphe moment since we are blending to built right now if you do not know every morphe brushes store that is open or is about to open does Carrie
jeffree star cosmetics hey I know a lot of you know that you've seen footage from the store openings which by the way I will be in a store opening very soon
honey we got some good things planned but if you don't know you can shop my entire brand in their store I love morphe I believe in them since
the beginning and they are amazing so a lot of you have asked Geoffrey why is in your brand and also or Sephora but as a choice I just want to really make that
clear here because some people that are you know a little negative like to switch things up and say oh you can't get in there you want to see the emails
girl upset no it's for personal reasons I have grown my business so massively all in my own through e-commerce I don't really want to dive into a huge retail
giant so I have put that on pause but morphe is expanding rapidly there will
be so many more stores opening before the years up and I am really excited to grow with someone I believe in not but I don't believe in other retailers it's
just they are very corporate and right now you know that's not the path I want
to go what do you guys think about collaboration there are so many brand collaborations so happening are going to happen or you guys burnt
out on influencer collabs do you guys want to see me clap with someone from my brand the comments section is yours bitch let me know alright kind of living
for this color story to be honest I'll make her alright so let's just you one more shade and we got to move on with the day honey I really want to take this
in pretty moments in here a VIP is cute let's take her the little brush let's just pack her on the inner corner right here let's see if it wants to work Oh
bitch she wants to work well just kind of shove her right in there flat then go
okay this is turning out really cute yes the vault alright mascara time y'all I didn't want to do this you know I live for Gucci but
most of you don't even know that they have a makeup line they do I reviewed it before ever reviewed their foundation two years ago now this mascara is dried
up bitch we're talking Sahara dry it's been in my vault for a long time so I'm
just gonna put it on and see what happens girl just expired I don't want to get a sister sty like James so let's just pray
this doesn't happen to me my lashes just look kind of like not that great it's not the best I think the packaging is beautiful of course I'm gonna hide it
geez all over it which basically sum up my entire life oh oh my god it doesn't have it only the cap does I changed my mind so see the cap it has the logo on
it of course but the base is a-ok no this is not looking that cute alright
mascara also Gucci if you want to do a collaboration with me for makeup email me it's time for lips I know a lot of you are like oh what lip product is you
gotta use I actually got two in mine here BAM the first one is I think it's one of the first shades she ever made this is the candy que Kylie lip kit so
candy k was a very early on color when I tried it I wasn't obsessed um her formula is just a little drawing i've liked some of the shades that she's
put out before but overall I'm not like in love with it I just think that there's so many products being put out it's not exciting anymore it's kind of
lackluster and I'm just kind of like over the brand at the moment maybe it's gonna read you know reaccept me in the future maybe not but right now kind of
like over it and just kind of like man let's put on this lip and ooh I do not miss that Center Oh between the hood of beauty and this sorry I'm gonna have
a migraine okay sorry people it took me a little bit longer than normal the formula was a
little dry in the bottle obviously I said it was expired it's not the brand's fault but just overall anyways to the bottom lip I've always just like a
little problem with them like it looks smooth and it looks prettier than a few minutes later it's just like really drying I know this was an earlier shade
and they have fixed it a little bit but like girl so besides this moving on we
are going to use something that I was so offended by I am still offended alright now we're gonna talk about the Christian Louboutins $85 lip gloss now speaking of
horrible smells this one smells so troche as' it's like that rose smell where it's just so strong and it lingers and doesn't go away I'm like actually
dreading putting this on my lips because I hate how it's right there under your nose it smells atrocious but an $85 gloss now we all know the packaging
looks sickening it's like medieval you can shove this up your ass I'm not sure what you I got a lot of like those look like butt plugs when I first reviewed
this so let's put it on we'll just pop it in the center so it gives it a little
bit of dimension I think the look is actually not that bad to finish the look honey all right we're down to the finish line we have one more product and
talking about overpriced horseshit that doesn't really work I love Armani beauty but this this is the Armani Prima refreshing makeup fix this is kind of
like a setting spray now I use this a few times and like sometimes you know a product is just like all about refreshing or it's about setting or
whatever it is great I saw literally zero difference I don't know what kind of ingredients are in this I don't know what happened here but this was just a
dud and Jesus Christ okay I saw I had to pause and Google the price because I forgot $70 for $70 bitch my makeup shouldn't move throughout the day like
girl I should pump my own gas alright let's give this one more world before she goes in the trash bin just even smell great I'm like okay waving it
around and just like last time I don't see much of a difference I see kind of nothing overall though I will say this after everything we've talked about the
look ain't really that bad tor is a fucking hot mess I think the cream one definitely ruined the look look at that jawline I'm so sorry ja but
yeah that is it for today's video thank you for watching and thank you for just listening to me and just sitting here and chatting I had a vent and get some
things off my chest so thank you to everyone for watching this video I really appreciate it of course all thoughts and opinions are my own please
don't go tell any brand anything on my behalf I don't give a fuck about anyone mentioned in this video if it was negative please leave them alone I just
wanted to be candid with you guys and tell you one on one the Realty so we can move along and you guys know what's up alright until the next time mwah bye
guys"
PowerfulJRE,"15,800,000","3,288,461,140","1,147",People & Blogs,2013,"two one boom and we're live first of all cheers gentlemen let's have a little
toast relax bob thank you very much for doing this i really appreciate it i understand that you've told this story many many
times you've been grilled many many times and it's very stressful for you so i really really appreciate your time
for people who don't know the story there is a documentary jeremy corbell has a documentary out
right now it's called bob lazar area 51 and ufos and flying saucers and flying
saucers bombs are air 51 and flying okay um i first heard your story decades ago
i've i told you last night we went out to dinner i've seen pretty much every interview you've ever given i've
followed the story incredibly closely but for people who don't know the story let's give them the bullet points you
used to work at area 51 in area 51 you got you you
went like well you know we want to be accurate okay area s4 s4 okay it's about 15 miles
south of area 51. okay um you worked
in what would you how would you describe it i i guess within the area 51 compound you can call
that a subset of area 51. and you got that job before that you were working
before that i had worked at los alamos right national labs in new mexico and you were involved in what kind of work
nuclear weapon development physics i mean that's they do everything there so how do they approach you
to say hey bob once you come on out to the nevada desert
well the way this went down was um at that time it was 1982
i had put a jet engine in my my honda
and los alamos put it on the front page of the paper said you know uh
los alamos man physicist at the lab you know built this 200 mile an hour you know on
the jet car that i drove to work every day so uh so i was known in los alamos the
guy with the weird car and you know you could hear it from you know a mile away anyway
the day that came out on the front page of the paper was the day edward teller the father of
the hydrogen bomb was giving a lecture down there at the lab
and we didn't have much going on that day in our group and i asked if i could go down there
and i went down there early and ed teller was outside
leaning on a brick wall there and reading the front page of the paper now there's a guy out of history so i
introduced myself hey i'm the guy you're reading about there and we talked for a little while and it was cool
uh you know fast forward to years later i had moved out to las vegas and had you know left los alamos and
you know went on to other things and i wanted to get back into the scientific community yeah i left start other
businesses and and that sort of thing so i sent resumes out and one of them went out to ed
teller and referenced our meeting you know back back in that the day
and uh anyway he remembered me and gave me a reference somebody to contact
at egng and that's pretty much how it started so
you get a phone call or a letter like what do you get
well i got a what did i get i got a letter initially
and um went down for an interview probably a couple times and it was down at eg g special projects which was um
at mccarran airport at that time out in las vegas and did they give you any sort of job description of what you were
applying for um they said it was for ed i can't remember exactly what they did
this was a long time ago but i i think it was um advanced propulsion or something like
that something relatively generic and they said it's in a remote area um
you know it's gonna be some days on some days off and um you know it was kind of a
it was kind of uh not exactly a full-time job but you might have to be out there for two weeks at a time and
take two weeks off so it was kind of uh the work schedule would be kind of broken up
and did this seem attractive to you or did it seem weird no it really wasn't weird because people
that work at the test site anybody that's familiar with the area up there um you know working at the nuclear test
site uh or at the tonopod test range north of there uh that's typically how
things go so you had known about it from the scientific community because the area 51 at that time was no they didn't
say anything about area 51. okay so they just said it was in a you know in a remote location and you just know it was
up at the test site right so but there was no mention of area 51 at that time so they've done
hundreds of nuclear tests in nevada and nevada that whole area was there's been
there's giant chunks of nevada the people yeah there's a big piece of nevada and it's split up into different
areas there's a nuclear test site there's area 51 there's the tonopod test range north of that there's little
sub-areas there's areas where they test chemical weapons and things like that so it's all broken up as a you know
gigantic test area so take me back to first day on the job you accept a job
they take you out there yeah it's um
the first day really i didn't really get to see a whole lot the first day was essentially just paperwork that's when i
flew into area 51 proper and i left mccarran airport
and flew what they call the janet flights just um you know a passenger plane from las
vegas to area 51 and it was really just going through
a mountain of paperwork that day from security clearances to um
god there was it was like two or three hours of just solid paperwork and that was that was really an uneventful first day
when did things get weird when did you realize that at what point
in time did you say hey this is not normal work like this doesn't even seem
like it's from this planet that i can't tell you what day that occurred on because so much time has
gone by the days have kind of fused into one and i can't separate the days was it a slow
burn or was there a moment of recognition well the
the first inkling i had was when i i came in normal there's this facility that is at s4
it's in the side of a mountain and normally we had pulled in with the bus
and gone around the front through a normal double door this time that i went in there were
hangar doors open i went into the hangar door and in the hangar door was the disc the flying
saucer that i worked on i saw it sitting there and we walked by it had a little american flag stuck on
the side and i thought oh my god this finally explains all the flying saucer stories this is just an advanced fighter
and it this is [ __ ] hilarious right so i went by i slid my hand alongside it
i got reprimanded immediately for touching the thing and uh there was a guy an armed guard that followed us in and just said keep
your eyes at forward and your hands at your side and just walk in the door so that was the first time i had seen
anything that was weird it was some time later that i was
introduced to my um my lab partner barry and we had some of the subcomponents of
the craft in the lab and barry was very anxious to get a new
lab partner so he was very talkative and couldn't wait to show me different things and it was in the demonstration
of the reactor working where it caught my attention to where
this is technology that doesn't even exist so i mean that was the first time i knew
that this is really something different what was it what was it what was a
what was it about this reactor that made you think that it didn't exist
technologically well it was the i actually have to back up because there were some briefings that i read it
before that that you know certainly gave me the
impression that this was going to be a weird job but this was the first hands-on thing this was a small reactor about the size
of a hemisphere about the size of a basketball on a metal plate and when it was running
it produced a gravitational field a gravitational field of its own now this is something that we can't do we can't
produce any gravity the only way we get gravity is from large quantities of mass
but there's no machine we can have that turns on that makes gravity like you know you can turn on an
electromagnet and it makes a magnetic field we can't make a gravitational field anyway this device was producing
that and barry said almost like he was bragging go ahead try and try and touch the sphere and i i
couldn't it would it pushed my hands away just like two like poles of a magnet so that was uh so like when you
take two magnets and try to press them together yeah you have this each other yeah kind of cushion feeling but you
can't you can't get them together the closer you put them the more they push but then you felt that physically with my hand yeah now there's nothing there's
nothing that does that and that immediately caught my attention going wow this is something else what
was your thought like when you felt that and you knew that there was nothing that you were aware of that could produce
that connected me to the briefings that i read on the the first day at s4 was that uh
you know everything that i had read was apparently accurate what were you reading
i read it was kind of an overview this project was to back engineer
the alien craft and specifically it was to try and back engineer and see if we can duplicate the
technology with available materials now to do this they split the project
into you know many different pieces for several reasons they do this on all classified projects so uh nobody has the
complete story but uh they compartmentalize everything now we had the power and propulsion system so what
the briefings they gave me were like a one or two page overview of some of the other projects that were going on you
know on the craft the only reason they do that is just in case what you're working on is connected intimately in
some way that we don't know of to one of the other projects you have to know there excuse me their existence so
um you know i but again everything from metallurgy to
um you know weapon potential the craft and these were all you know essentially
very short briefings but mine was just power and propulsion and
it made it very clear that what i read was accurate so when you're reading that before you
actually saw the reactor what were your thoughts on what they were describing
if you knew that something like that didn't exist and they're describing it in the briefings
what did you think you were going to see i really i i didn't know at the time i mean i was reading i thought is this
just some kind of test um see if you're crazy well not to see if i'm crazy to
you know a lot of times they'll take in real high security uh jobs i mean they'll intentionally insert
nonsense into them um whether it's to confuse the fact or if for someone was to leak it out
they would carry that information along and know where it came from so i read through the documents but you know
i didn't know if this was you know part of some kind of test or um
you know or what or was it potentially realistic i mean i really didn't consider it being
all that possible as far as being uh the actual thing that i was going to work on at the time how did they turn it
on the the reactor yeah the reactor can be turned on or turned off in a lot of
different ways um the way barry showed me at the hemisphere is removed
there's a small tower in the middle when you put the hemisphere on the reactor activates
the reactor shuts down it's it's load sensing so if there's if there's no load
on the reactor at all it shuts down when there's a load present on it it starts up again load meaning
you can consider it an electrical load so although it doesn't necessarily operate
electrically there's no wiring that connects any of the sub components together whatsoever they just have to be
in the immediate vicinity it's uh it is but the stuff is borderline magic
and that's essentially where we left it you know when i left the project
so there was no progress made there was some progress i mean we did identify at least we think some
processes and and had a rough idea we think of what was going on but
i think this is a problem that they've had for a long time and um
you know i was replacing somebody that barry worked with prior to me and i think there was some horrific accident
that i didn't have a whole lot of information on but you know barry alluded to that
horrific accident like where someone died or yeah where somebody died because they were trying to tamper with things
or figure out how something worked yeah the reactor in particular but yeti let you touch it
yeah i think what they were trying to do was cut into one now they had they had more than one there and they that was
supposedly there was an unannounced nuclear test and that's what it was at the time remember
they would still do an underground nuclear test at the test site um but from what i understand according to
barry there was an attempt made now this must have been a pretty desperate intent because it's not a very scientific
process to cut you know analyze something that way but it looked like they used a plasma cutter or something
like that to cut into an operating reactor how many of these things did they have they had nine nine
craft altogether i only got hands on with one of them so i can't really
say what the how the others operated did you see the other ones yeah at one time and only one time the bay doors that
between the hangers were all open and i could see all the way through and
were they all exactly the same no they were all different different shapes yeah but they were all from somewhere else
yeah absolutely now did anyone make any attempt to explain
or to to tell you where they came from no no no one is the least bit interested in
letting everybody know all the facts they want to give you the minimum information that's necessary to
complete your task so you're not getting the story of where they came from you're not getting the
story of what how much progress other people are making you just focus on the small component but they gave you
some indication that they've been working on these for a while yeah when do you think they
acquired these i really couldn't say i think they've been around for a while
so they bring you into this room you see this reactor working you you realize
this is nothing that as far as like the scientific community at current time
has the ability to create we still don't what is your life like from that moment
on is that where everything changes because you do you i mean i would imagine the moment you actually make
contact with something that's extraterrestrial whether it's an object or a being something where you can
actually absolutely be certain it's not from here your whole paradigm the whole world you
live in is now a different place well this is the only time it became exciting you know the rest of the time the it was
really an ominous feeling being at work but it at that time
it was exciting i mean this was now i knew we were on the absolute be actually
beyond the cutting edge of science and i was i was so absolutely excited to be there
every single time i was um you know it would this was a fantastic
opportunity and however
in short order it began to concern me we really have no idea what we're talking
about and the excitement kind of turned to dread
at some point because the amount of power we're dealing with is astronomical i mean to
affect gravity to produce the effects like this equipment does takes huge
amounts of power and i've given the example before of
you know taking a small portable nuclear reactor and you know putting it back into victorian times you know with the
scientists of the time and just dropping it in a room and they come and look at it and see that it's producing power
and wonder how it works so they start taking it apart and as soon as they get some of the
shielding off the people are going to drop dead because of the radiation inside now the people have no idea that
radiation even exists back then but anybody that comes in to check on him will also drop dead and
you know there's no reason that that exact scenario couldn't happen with what we're
dealing with we have no idea how the physics operate within this thing the
power levels are are like i said astronomic like it's incredibly dangerous to tinker with something like
that and you know in some respects we were guinea pigs just try to find out how to
make this thing so they had a series as far as you're surmised that a series of different
scientists try to back engineer this thing try to figure out what this thing was and they would bring in new people
and like let's throw bob at it yeah yeah and they i know i don't know how many but i knew there was certainly one
before me and i knew he died during the analysis of the or the reactor itself and
you don't know how many have worked on it and no one gave this could have been there for
50 years it could have been there for five years when they're giving you instructions what are they saying like
when they're giving you direction they're showing you all the stuff like what what are they saying what specifically what are they asking of you
well essentially what they ask is is what i said all we are just to gather as much information as possible find out
how it operates and see if we can duplicate it so but they always realize you where it was from they never let you
ask questions about where it's from well if the information i read in the briefings
was accurate now what i do have to say is the information that pertained directly
to the reactor was accurate what i read did
i mean did jive with reality um in terms of how in terms of how it was made how what we
saw how it operated the materials how it you know turned on and what was discovered uh
discovered about it i'm sorry the migraine is really making it hard for me to thank you sorry no
we talked that before the podcast you tell her buddy bob is getting a migraine i know you're very stressed out by this which is one of the reasons why i
appreciate you doing this um where was i already we were talking oh right yeah explained it
and uh so there was some paperwork that indicated that this was from the zeta
reticuli star system now yeah now how they obtain that i haven't
i haven't the slightest idea but it wasn't just from the zeta reticuli star system it was
what they called zr3 so it was a third planet in that star system so
there was no other information about it other than that supposedly where the craft came from now is that true i don't
know i have no way of verifying that but that was printed in the same materials that referenced the reactor now i looked
that stuff up when i went home and zeta reticular is a binary star
two stars that orbit orbit one another and it's only visible in the southern hemisphere and it's about thirty some
odd light years away so that's literally all the information i have about that i don't know how they found out it came
from there and you also probably have some suspicions that they give you some disinformation like you were talking
about before they would yeah yeah to i mean if you ever decided to talk about
this they added a bunch of nonsense to make whatever is factual look ridiculous right or be able to trace it down like
hey this facts came out and you know this lazar guy said it you know came from zeta reticulate so they knew it was
when we read zeta reticulate we're like what in the [ __ ] is this well reading
all of this stuff it was what in the [ __ ] is this you're like why did i sign up for this no no
to me this was cool this is interesting i said i was just excited to be out in a secure area you know in the middle of
the desert i said this is awesome how old are you i get as in my 20s
yeah so you're probably totally geeked out oh yeah this was this was great i mean i i was
excited so i didn't care reading through everything and so you read through all the zeta reticuli thing but then when you see the actual
starship with the little american flag sticker on it well that was was that later or before
that that was before so before so you see the thing before and you say oh this is
where what's that before hard so many years yeah i can't either way it doesn't matter the days
have fused together it's so hard to separate what happened in each visit do you remember the thought process when
you read that it's from zeta reticuli yeah it it it it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks or anything it's just like
yeah okay you think it was [ __ ] i don't know this is where i don't know now i don't i
mean because when i read it i hadn't verified anything and this was just a bunch of stuff i was reading and i
thought maybe after this they're just going to give me a test and see what i can remember in right crazy information
and it would but like i said when i finally went in with barry
um and had hands-on experience with what they were talking
about it taught on a completely different meaning so there's a plate there's this
thing that looks like a half a basketball and when it's on you can't come anywhere near it you can't touch it right how is
what is gravity about that like the the concept of gravity to most people gravity is bringing something towards it right well
i guess you would say it's anti-gravity it's gravity shifted 180 degrees it's uh
you know anti-gravity and did they have any understanding
about what could possibly create this effect did they have any
areas where they'd like you to look into no they
well they knew there was a fuel source in it and they were proficient
at making it work and again my analogy to something like this is you can drop a motorcycle off in
the wagon train days and just leave it with the keys parked outside you know somebody's place everybody will come
around it and they'll poke and prod and eventually they'll turn the key get it to start and become proficient at
writing it yeah but they won't be able to understand what the hell's going on they
won't be able to make the plastic fender much less anything else and i think that's exactly the state we were at we
played around with the parts long enough before i got there where they could make the reactor operate
take the fuel out and know that it makes it work how exactly what was going on
in the reactor remained a mystery at the time i think we made some progress on
what was going on inside but i don't think anybody really knew anything they could just watch what was going on and
make note of it how long were you there i'd say about six months or so and what
what progress was made while you were there well we came up with a bunch of
reasonably good ideas about how the reactor worked and one of them was the base the square
base of it was essentially like a cyclotron which is a small particle accelerator a circular one particle
accelerators linear particle accelerators are just a you know long tube essentially and they
accelerate particles with high voltage and you know radio frequencies till they reach high speeds but a cyclotron does
that in a smaller circular area and there is this
very heavy element fuel element 115 something that wasn't on our periodic charts
at the time but it is now it is now yeah when did it become on the periodic table
now the way the charts now you know i don't remember do you remember when they 2004
durhamstat germany i think is where they first fabricated four atoms they lasted 220 milliseconds with the atoms it's
nothing right and then it later was discovered a couple more times they could fabricate it then they gave it
they gave it a place then on the periodic chart after that called it muscovium so they told you about this
stuff in 1982 yeah well we can 82 what what year
was this it was 88 and 89 when i was there 82 is one 82 was when you're in
los alamos i'm sorry yeah so 88.89 they told you about this stuff so this was not like no they didn't they didn't tell
me about it that's one of the things that this group came up with the um
um i keep losing my train of thought with this thing so this one area this
this element 115 was the fuel yeah it was the fuel um
the the world will forgive you for having a migraine i can i just it's really hard to think throughout this case
i just want to say one yeah definitely as i said one thing you know but for the last 30 years
people have just been on the attack on bob you know getting to know him the personal effects on his life it's really
hard to understand unless you meet his family and his wife i mean this is the last thing he wanted
to [ __ ] do was have to talk yeah we should explain that jeremy you and i had this conversation i watched your
documentary we had this conversation and i said i have to talk to him yeah the document
there's there's been detractors there's been a bunch of people that called [ __ ] on many of the things that
you've said but over time many of the things that you talked about
even in the 80s have proven to be true things that people said were not true were proven to be true element 115 was
one of them right right right element 115 the fuel they had was stable
in other words it didn't decay it wasn't emitting radioactivity um when they synthesized the two or three atoms of
the 115 uh it did decay and it was not a stable element so
they're they're kind of two different things but this is kind of typical elements always have or pretty much always have
uh stable isotopes and unstable isotopes like i think cesium has like
30 unstable isotopes to it so all right well hydrogen for example you're familiar with hydrogen gas
it's stable it's not radioactive but there's also two other types of hydrogen
deuterium and tritium and deuterium isn't radioactive it's another
stable isotope hydrogen but tritium is radioactive now they're all hydrogen but they just have a different amounts of
neutrons so it's the same thing with other elements n element 115. depending
on the amount of neutrons it has designates the isotope but it's 115 they
will continue to take or experiment and try and make 115 at
different isotopes and i'm sure eventually they'll come up with a stable version but it's the stable version that
has the properties that we're talking about so they somehow or another had acquired a stable version did they say
that the stable version had come with this craft it absolutely came with the graft yeah so at the time you having a
firm knowledge of the periodic chart and knowing what was real and what wasn't real what was your reaction to having
this stable element 115 that wasn't even supposed to exist well everything was impossible right i mean down down to the
metal i i did get a chance uh to look inside the craft on only one
occasion and this was important because where the reactor sat
might have been critical to how it operated since everything operates without any interconnection so the
placement of components might be critical so they allowed me to go inside and and look at it
um dude again i forgot where the hell i am so you're going into this craft and what
are you thinking when you're inside of it like what are you seeing it's um it's a very ominous feeling because it's
there are no at first of all everything is one color it's like a dark pewter color
and there are no right angles anywhere it's as if somebody took uh i've said
this before somebody took a a model out of and fashioned it out of wax and then
heated it just for a short time so everything melted everything looks like it's fused together everything has a
radius of curvature where two uh items meet it's uh it's a really weird looking
thing but um uh there was almost nothing
other than a small foldable hatchway that that looked recognizable everything was
uh was really unworldly depicting it a way to describe it so you
you get inside this thing and it's designed for something that's much smaller than a human being yeah you can't really stand up till you get to
the very center of it and how tall are you i'm 5 10. and what do you think this was designed for i'd say something close to
half my height wow so these little three foot tallish creatures
yeah and the the seats were small too i mean obviously it was made you know for something something small but there's no
like there's there's nothing else in there there's just seats the reactor and some of the sub components there's no
there's no control panels there's no bathroom there's no no decorative uh components or artwork
or anything that you would recognize or trim i mean it's just a very bare bones
thing you're not seeing any screens well there are archways around it that
are part of the superstructure and that one of the archways can become
transparent when i was in there there was another group working on one of the archways and
you could call that a screen more or less so through that archway it would be it
would maintain the solidity the the solid whatever metal it was yeah but you could
yeah it just became transparent yeah i saw that happen once or twice before i left did you ask any questions about
what the phone no there's no there's no asking questions no but when you watch something become
transparent and you realize it's still there but you could now see through it yeah i mean now that's not that
impressive we do have some liquid crystal materials that are like that you know they are seen in smart glass
yeah they call it smart glass so this is just uh and i don't know if the craft is made of
you know an advanced metal or a ceramic it was cold to the touch so um you know i would lean in more
towards the metal you're not allowed to ask questions no the only there they work on the buddy
system so i can only exchange ideas and talk to barry now this really interferes with science
because science is based on free discussion and ideally you get a bunch of guys together exchange ideas work on
problems and that's how things move forward but they're so over the top concerned
about security they split everything off and everybody becomes stagnant it it
it just destroys any of the progress you can make or at least makes it go so slow
um they i think they wind up shooting themselves in the foot which is probably why they
arrived at this bottleneck that they needed to get this madman with a jet powered honda to come in and see what he
could do i think that was an act of desperation i think they wanted someone that thinks out of the box and let's
just give this guy a try here because they weren't and uh they might have done this four more times since uh you know up to
the point in time today assuming they're still working on this thing and when you see this craft and you're
inside was there any indication that there was an area that they would use to control it to pilot
was there a pilot seat was there's there were three seats they sat around uh the reactor was in the
dead center of it and then equidistant around there were three seats
so and that's all there was a a large you would they're not consoles there are
large rectangular objects also spaced equidistant around the center um there's
nothing on them there's no buttons there's no lights and they control the same color everything is the same color
different shape right and um directly underneath them there's three levels in the craft uh the main level is
what we're talking about directly under that those are the gravity amplifiers the big
rectangular objects underneath them are the gravity emitters that look like for lack of a better word a trash can
hanging on a pipe three of those and then the top layer i this is just my personal belief i
think that has to do with a a navigation or their version of a computer uh with some planar panels
sensor panels around the craft that we would call portholes but they're not portholes they're just black areas and i
think that just determines its you know position in space but i was i i physically was in the
center section and i stuck my torso in the bottom section and hung upside down so i could see
how the gravity amplifiers were positioned what is the the roughly the size of this thing it's a i think it
i don't remember from being there but um after all this stuff was over i had uh
john andrews a guy from the testers model corporation and you know we sat down and tried to figure out from what i
saw um and known sizes of things and we came up with 52 feet in diameter
so i think that's really small yeah so i think that's a fair a reasonable guess now you said there's nine of them and
you got a brief glimpse at the other ones were they how are they different oh
they looked completely different one looked like i called it jello mold and it it looked like a classic jello mold
with the rippled sides to it one was a very flat disc um
you know like a oh i don't like a straw hat or something like that that was sitting up on its
edge and the thin part of it had looked like a projectile had been fired through
the edge of it so i don't know if they were attempting to see if the metal could be penetrated or if something or

- Yeah! - ( donkey braying )
Oh, yeah!
Sweet! That was awesome.
( music playing )
Yeah! Whoo!
Run it, dude. Yes!
Run! Go, go, go!
( laughing )
Whoo!
- That was awesome, dude. - Dude, awesome.
- What did you guys think? - Nailed it.
All right, so we got this boy Angelo.
His mom sent in this video.
He's in a wheelchair.
He loves to be active.
- He can ride wheelies and do 360s. - Whoa.
This boy's awesome.
He deserves an epic day.
An epic couple days.
I am Angelo Moss.
I'm 16 years old and I'm in the 11th grade.
I am in a wheelchair because
I am an amputee and I have spina bifida.
Spina bifida restricts a lot of people
'cause they won't be able to use their legs as much,
so I work around that
and use my arms and upper body a lot more.
Life has been awesome!
I'm very active,
I love playing sports because
it just brings me happiness,
makes me keep going.
Whoo!
I love basketball a lot
because I have so much speed.
How I play sports is with my own chair
unless they let me borrow one.
This chair might break in a while.
Lilliana: I am nominating for Angelo to have a day of fun,
where he can continue to smile
and the world can see...
the joy...
and the energy that Angelo radiates...
out of his little soul.
( music playing )
Surprising Angelo
( siren wailing )
We are
headed to Angelo's house right now.
I'm so pumped to meet this kid.
Like, I can't wait to give this kid an epic adventure.
You always do.
You give me an epic adventure every day.
( laughs )
All right, so I'm gonna call Lilliana,
that's his mom, and give her the heads up that we're on the way.
Lilliana: Hello?
Is this Lilliana?
Yes, it is.
So, we're like three minutes out.
I'm super, super excited.
The boys have no idea.
I hope he's ready for a great day.
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Yeah, this is gonna be great.
I always know I'm really excited
when I actually get nervous
'cause I don't get nervous easy.
All right, stop here, stop here, stop here.
I don't want him to see us.
( music playing )
Yo!
Oh, my God!
What's up?
- What's up, my man? - Hi.
- How are you? - Good.
- Oh, my God. - Hi, Mom.
- How are you? - Good, and yourself?
I'm awesome.
I'm so excited to meet you guys.
I can already tell we're gonna have a lot fun with these guys.
Strike me out.
- Oh! - ( laughs )
I just ruined the game.
I'm out.
So what's going on here?
This is my basketball chair,
this is another basketball chair,
and this is my hand cycle.
- Whoa, this one looks cool. - Yeah.
You're gonna have to show me how to do a wheelie or something.
Oh, I should take him down there.
Yeah, let's go.
- Don't touch the wheel. - All right.
Yo. ( laughing )
Yo, where--
Whoo!
Dude, we're drifting!
And that chair's obviously built for, like, romping.
No, not at all.
Angelo's out here killing it.
He does tricks.
I'd just fall and hurt myself.
Probably.
Well, we've seen the tricks,
we've seen the skills.
Show me around. Let's see your place.
This your place?
Yeah. Hold on.
Dude!
( laughs )
What did you just do?
- You're used to it. - Yeah.
You're like, ""That's what he does.""
- That was fast. - Yeah.
- Wicked fast. - He's super speedy.
This is the place, huh?
Lilliana: Apartment's really, really tiny,
and so we kind of share space all together.
I have a day bed, it has a trundle,
so one child will sleep with me.
- This is the bed, it pulls out, so we have two beds. - Right on.
Well, look, man, we're gonna have some serious fun.
- I can tell. - There's nothing I want to do more
than just give you guys a great time.
It's all we got to do.
Lilliana: That's all that counts.
If you guys want, I want to take you to a skate park.
Okay, that would be perfect.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
Fun in the sun, baby.
Lilliana: Let's get ready.
( phone line ringing )
Man: Hello?
Listen, uh, just met with Angelo and the family.
These kids are so inspiring.
Just went to their house.
He's got to actually climb up stairs
to even get in his house.
There's no wheelchair accessibility.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm thinking, like, you go apartment hunting.
- Apartment hunting? - They need space.
A nice place that feels like home
for the mom and the two boys.
All right, got it, I'm on it.
Have fun.
So let's do it.
Let's hit that skate park.
Lilliana: Let's do it.
? Tear it down ?
Skate Park
? Ratchet up, ratchet up ?
? Come on, know it feels good to me ?
? Tear it down ?
? Na, na, na, na... ?
Roman: I'm gonna surprise Angelo.
We're going to a skate park
and the legend Aaron Wheelz
from Nitro Circus
is gonna show up and surprise him.
And they're gonna get to ride together,
skate in this park together. It's awesome.
We've got Wheelz hiding behind, like, this little saddle.
We're gonna bring him in, try to surprise him.
- Place is huge, right? - Yes.
It's like the biggest skate park I've ever been to.
Angelo: It's ginormous.
- You excited? - Yeah.
Roman: This doesn't look too intimidating?
- Angelo: Somewhat. - As a mom, it does.
Who's the one guy that does this?
His name is Aaron.
He's amazing.
He did the first back flip on a wheelchair.
Crazy.
Aaron Wheelz. Yeah.
( music playing )
( Lilliana laughing )
Hi, Aaron!
Hey.
Angelo, how's it going, bro?
Good to meet you.
You know what you just got yourself into?
- (laughter ) - Yeah.
Aaron's here to have some fun with you, like...
- Dope. - Give you some tips, some tricks.
- Let's send it. - Let's go.
It's Aaron. This is crazy.
I'm a big fan, he's pretty awesome.
This day can't get any better.
I definitely think you can do this one wheelie.
- Like the one-wheel manual. - Okay.
Just, like, go fast and pull it up.
That's crazy.
And then keep pushing the other one.
- Okay. - So the one that's on the ground, just...
- So like that? ( screams ) - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
( laughs )
Roman: I love that he loves falling.
- That's the first step. - Oh, you got this.
All right, so while they're having a good time,
Aaron's, like, giving him some lessons, some pointers...
Oh!
But I think Angelo needs a better chair,
with, like suspension, like Aaron's,
so we got this.
Boom.
Aaron: Yo, he's getting it.
- Yo, you want to try this one out? - Yeah.
This looks pretty sweet?
- Yeah. - Right here.
A new chair? This is crazy.
Feels great.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
This new chair is amazing.
It's especially designed for skating.
Yes! Just what I needed.
You got some suspension in the front wheels,
and then you got the springs in the back,
so makes those landings a little less rough.
You want to carve some bowls?
Sure, why not?
I like that.
( music playing )
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's not afraid to go fast.
That was crazy fast.
Man, keep pushing.
Wow.
In this moment,
it's Angelo's time.
There's no boundaries, there's no limitation.
He's good. It gives me great joy
to see him 'cause he has such a big smile.
You see him happy.
'Cause no matter what he goes through,
he's always smiling
and he never lets anything stop him.
- You want to try and drop in on coping? - Sure.
When you go over the edge, you want to
- just kind of keep the front up. - Okay.
Just real smooth-like.
Yes.
You're killing it, buddy!
Just try to turn and lean on that one wheel.
You make it look so easy.
No. Ugh.
( screams )
Roman: What do you think?
- Oh, it's awesome. - He's so good.
Hey, man, I need some good luck.
Good luck.
Alonzo: He's gonna do a flip now?
I'll jump off here into there...
No pressure, buddy.
- No pressure? - No pressure at all.
No pressure, but land it.
( laughing ) No pressure.
He's coming in.
Shoo.
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
Aaron: Saved it.
No way.
That was nuts.
You both looked crazy out there,
but you killed it.
Completely unstoppable.
What did you think of Aaron's back flip?
It was cool!
You're gonna do a back flip someday.
Yeah, someday,
but not today, that's for sure.
What do you think of the chair?
The chair is pretty cool.
You should bring it on our trip.
What trip?
- Tomorrow. - What's tomorrow?
- We're getting on a plane. - A plane?
Going to Rochester for Nitro Circus.
- What the heck? - ( laughs )
The whole Nitro Circus crew is pumped to meet you.
Roman: Aaron's going with us.
- Can you believe that? - No.
Going to Nitro, baby.
That's awesome.
I'm so excited to go to New York.
This is amazing.
Nitro Circus does the craziest stunts ever
so I am psyched to go.
( music playing )
Nitro & Real Estate
You guys ready for some fun?
- Yeah. - Of course.
Let's go see Wheelz.
- Hi. - Hey.
How was your trip?
Angelo: Cool.
So did you check out the ramps yet?
No, I haven't yet.
- Oh, no? - Yeah, you want to roll out there?
Uh, sure.
( laughter )
You got to see this, man.
It's something to see.
( music playing )
Roman: This sweet or what?
Angelo: These people are crazy.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm at Nitro Circus.
The mega ramp is crazy huge.
That's like two million of me trying to get up there,
that's how high I think it is.
They have a stretcher ready?
I know, that's not that encouraging.
They should put a blanket over that or something.
It really should be, like, hidden a little bit, you know?
- Where you guys headed? - You know what?
We're just checking out the place,
letting him see some practice, some warm ups.
You want to come up to the top of the ramp?
- Yes. - Come with me.
There was no hesitation.
( music playing )
Oh, my goodness.
How's this for a front-row seat?
You're the closest you could possible get
to these bikes right now.
Here we go, dude!
( engines revving )
Whoo-hoo!
Yo!
Yes!
Oh, my gosh!
That was awesome.
( music playing )
So just landed in Los Angeles.
That's a famous road right there.
Now I feel like I'm in the movies.
We gotta look for an apartment for Angelo and his family.
He's in a wheelchair so we need handicap accessibility.
I'm meeting with a realtor named Sandra.
I figured I could use the help since I don't have much time.
Hopefully everything checks out.
It'd be nice to just walk in, buy the place, boom, done.
This, uh, postal worker wants to race.
Bring it on.
I'm from Ohio! Let's go, buddy.
( music playing )
It's two bedroom, one bath, hardwood floors.
Plenty of parking, that's good.
Here it is, it's upstairs.
Oh.
Upstairs isn't gonna work.
Um... we need wheelchair accessibility.
This one's out, we don't even need to go any further.
( music playing )
How was he at the skate park?
Oh, he was dropping in...
You think he could drop in here?
Yeah.
You want to drop in?
Yeah.
When you go down,
just don't lean too far forward.
Just kind of chill a little bit.
Okay.
Aaron: You were killing it at the skate park,
so this is just the next step.
Oh, my gosh!
How you feeling?
Good.
It's not too bad.
Come on, Angelo!
Yeah!
( screams )
Yeah, dude!
( laughs )
Right into the bag!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Five, bud!
Dialed.
- Was that fun? - That was so awesome!
( Roman laughs )
- No! - (laughs )
Yo, Angelo, since you did something new today,
I'm gonna try something new today...
All right.
...that I've never done.
I'll try a back flip.
Way out of my league here.
( chuckling ) Yo.
Oh, my God!
All right, here comes Ryan, look at him.
You know it's getting close when Ryan's bringing her over.
Angelo: Roman is gonna go on a tricycle.
He said he might back flip as well.
He's crazy.
All right, guys.
I'm headed up.
The super duper staircase.
My first time ever on a mega ramp.
Stay straight. Stay straight.
Stay straight, lean back, got it.
Aaron: This is when we're just happy that we're just chilling.
- Yeah. - And watching.
Let these guys do all the bad ideas.
It's straight down!
Whoo! My heart is beating.
There's no way he could this.
He's gonna hurt himself.
Stay straight, look at the take off.
Okay, I'm ready.
All right, buddy. Stay straight, boy.
Three, two...
? I'm faster than a bullet train ?
? Oh! ?
( cheering )
( laughing )
? Just call my name ?
? Dick Van Rock ?
? Ha! ?
Thank you guys so much, man.
Yo.
You're crazy.
I honestly did not
have any clue what was gonna happen
when I hit that ramp.
( music playing )
I just leaned back.
I didn't know where I was at, then all of a sudden,
I see the down side and I just tried to stay on the bike
the best I could.
It's too bad my brother Dale's in L.A. looking for apartments,
but his job is just as important as ours right now.
Angelo and his family have no idea what's about to happen.
( music playing )
I'm so short on time. This is so frustrating.
Hopefully the next place is perfect 'cause
I need to move the whole family's house
before they get back.
( music playing )
Okay.
So let me call the landlord.
He's supposed to meet us. I'll be right back.
All right.
I like that there's gates.
That's nice.
Big car port.
Bad news.
He's not picking up.
- What does that mean? - He's not answering
and we can't get in unless he's here.
I'm running out of time, Sandra.
I know, I'm so sorry.
( groans )
( music playing )
Nitro Circus Live
So I just want to say thank you guys so much
for allowing me, Angelo and his family
to be a part of this today.
It is an absolute honor.
- We're both having a killer time. - Yes.
Thank you for letting this happen.
- Truly. - ( cheering )
( cheers, applause )
Angelo, we're just so pumped to have you here
and have you part of the show.
But before you go out there with us,
um, let's see... we got you a...
- Yeah, dude! - ...your own jersey.
( cheers, applause )
- Thank you. - That is sick.
This is awesome, thank you.
- Welcome to the family. - Yeah, man.
Man: Part of the team!
And Roman, we didn't forget about you, bud.
- No way! Yes! - ( cheers, applause )
Whoo! No way, dude!
That is dope. Thanks, guys, I mean, seriously.
From the bottom of our hearts, this is amazing.
Let's not sleep tonight. Let's just go mad.
So bring it in, say ""no sleep"" on three.
- One, two, three. - All: No sleep!
( cheers, applause )
This is awesome.
A lot more people than there was earlier, huh?
Angelo: A lot more.
I don't think there's not one empty seat.
- There all here for you, bro. - Welcome to the show, dude.
- Thank you. - Glad to have you here, man.
All right, we got the jersey. Show's about to start.
Let's light it up!
( music playing )
These people are crazy.
Woman: Whoo!
- Angelo: A scooter! - Roman: That's right.
Oh, that's sick.
Roman: Here we go, a cooler!
Whoo!
- Oh, my God! - That's crazy.
That was back to back.
Roman: That's a snowboard, dude.
That was sick.
( music playing )
Man, I'm out of time.
This is one of the last chances.
Oh, nice.
Fresh paint, it's clean.
Hardwood floor, that should be perfect for a wheelchair.
This is the place. It's got it all.
Let's make this happen.
Yes!
Aw, yes, dude!
Angelo, give me some good luck, bro.
- Good luck. - I'm gonna send a front flip.
Let's go! Let's go, Wheelz!
Whoo!
Roman: Yo, I've waited forever to see him do this.
This is, like, actually kind of insane.
- Whoo! - Let's go, Wheelz!
Roman: Oh, he's ready, dude.
This jump is dedicated to Angelo.
- Whoo! - Way to go!
What do you got up your sleeve?
Well, if you guys get loud enough,
I'm gonna send a front flip.
( cheers, applause )
There he goes.
Roman: Oh!
Oh, my gosh.
( crowd cheering )
Can we do one more?
Yeah, let's do it again.
He's going again, man.
He wants it.
He wants it.
Angelo: He just fell,
but he's about to try again.
I'm nervous for him.
- Roman: Two times the charm, right? - Angelo: Yep.
( music playing )
- Roman: Here we go, here we go! - Angelo: Whoo!
( cheering )
Yes! You killed it, dude!
That was awesome!
Yeah!
That was dope.
Whoo!
- That was sick, right? - Yeah!
Holy cow.
Out of control.
- That was for you, brother. - Thank you. That was awesome.
I didn't want to roll away with just a crash.
I know, man. You killed it, bro.
You killed it.
( music playing )
Everything they do is out of control.
- It's all for you, bro. - Thank you.
The jerseys, everything.
I hope you had the best night ever.
- It was the best night ever. - Yeah!
I had a lot of fun.
Thank you, thank you, and thank you.
Seeing Wheelz land that second jump was electrifying.
Wheelz taught me just to keep going.
Even if you just fail like 200,000 times.
You'll get it eventually.
Right now I feel on top of the world.
I feel like I can do anything.
( music playing )
New Digs
All right, guys, just like that
we're warping back to Los Angeles.
Two flights, all-night flights,
getting here to beat Angelo and his family back to their house.
We got one more surprise for Angelo,
and one more big surprise for the whole family.
We're just waiting on the wheelchair guy.
He's dropping off this state-of-the-art wheelchair.
It's got an electric motor in it.
It looks like a race car.
Push the button and it drives.
We're under the gun for time, still.
It's still an amazing time crunch.
( music playing )
? I'm floating ?
? In outer space ?
Roman: All right, this is crunch time.
We are down to the wire.
We're putting the final touches into making this place a home.
We're getting the couch in, curtains up.
We're so out of time. I'm gonna jump in here
and help 'em bust some of this stuff out.
? ...go without your... ?
? And then I can see your smile ?
Aw, yeah.
Let me make sure the TV's working.
I'll make sure the cable's on and hooked up.
Will one of you hand me that remote?
Just kidding. It's crunch time.
All right, so I'm gonna stage up behind this wall.
They're gonna come down here and they think--
We have a camera, we have a crew,
and they think they're gonna do like a walk-up for the show.
They have no idea I'm here. I'm just gonna jump out
and scare 'em and surprise 'em.
- ( exclaims ) - ( family squeals )
What's up, fam?
- How you doin', bud? - Good.
- Did you guys think that was it? - Yeah.
- I got one more thing. - Uh oh.
All right? All we gotta do is hop back in the car.
- You in for it? - Yeah.
- What's up, bro? - Hey!
You guys know my brother Dale, don't you?
- Snappers. - Angelo.
- Great to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.
We got you a little something.
Angelo: Oh, my gosh!
Bluetooth, and it's got a motor.
- Wow. - Angelo: This is crazy!
- I love it. - Just for those days
where, you know, you don't want to do the one-armed pull-ups.
- Yeah, I need it. - Yeah, look at this.
You wear this, and it controls the whole thing.
- That's cool. - It's fast, too.
- This is super amazing. - Let's give it a ride.
You think you can get up this thing?
Oh, look at you.
This door looks so familiar, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it does. - Yeah, those are our magnets.
What? Is this your door?
No, our home's over there.
No way!
What the heck?
- Oh, my God. - This is all our stuff!
What?
Oh, my gosh.
Roman: This looks like you guy's new house.
It's decked out, new, new, new.
- New stuff. - Angelo: Oh, my gosh.
- New room! - Oh, my gosh!
This is awesome. I wanted to do this so bad.
What do you think of your beds?
This is cool.
Man: Yeah, he had no problem taking that top bunk.
Man: Yeah, he's taking that top bunk.
I'm feeling on cloud nine right now.
This is insane.
Roman just surprised me with a new house.
You might be able to turn this into one of the mega ramps, dude.
- Oh, my gosh! - ( laughter )
I'm too happy, I don't know.
These tears are coming from tears of joy.
Mom, is this your room?
Man: This is definitely her room.
- Oh! - Dang.
This is huge!
This is all for you guys. This is our gift to you.
To be able to have a new house,
kids have their own room,
it's like a new beginning.
You guys got lots more space, man.
It's what we need, and it's accessible,
which is important for Angelo.
- Ramp out front. - Yep.
- Was built today. - Custom welded!
Can't buy that ramp.
In a few years, we'll be at Nitro Circus,
- redoing those flips. - Yeah.
I'll be going down the mega ramp this time.
Yeah. Yeah.
Roman, I'd like to thank you for all that you've done,
this past weekend, today.
I know I'll make you proud with this.
Big family hug. We love you guys.
- Angelo: Thank you. - Nothing's more important than family.
You guys gotta stick together.
- Enjoy this house. - See ya.
- Lilliana: Thank you so much. - You're welcome.
- You did awesome, dude. - Thanks, man.
You crushed it. Like, I'm speechless.
That house is beautiful.
It's beautiful.
( beating out rhythm )
? We're here with Roman and we're thinking about ideas ?
? We can't come up with anything, but I need some pizza ?
- Yeah! - ? Coming in now and I'm gonna wait till ?
? The food hits the table, that's how I'm able ?
? To eat real good and come up with good things ?
? I got great things coming your way ?
? You are Dale and I hate you ?
? But Roman's my friend so I tolerate you ?
- ( clicking tongue ) - Dale: Not cool.
Way too early '90s.
I do like you, Dale.
Don't touch me."

ABC News,"15,400,000","13,685,813,397","84,142",News & Politics,2006,"what happens when even walking outside
causes extreme pain well for the brave
girl you're about to meet simple
pleasures like splashing in a pool or
running in a playground led to a
baffling set of symptoms until one
doctor discovered the unlikely source of
her suffering
here's ABC's Abbie Boudreau it's every
parent's worst nightmare a happy child
who normally looks like this reduced to
this someday she would just cry for
hours and hours on him and it just felt
like lava was being poured on me like it
burns from the inside out a medical
mystery he's also hopeless there's
nothing you can do
Savannah Fulkerson was four years old
living in sunny California when her mom
Andrea first noticed something strange
we'd be outside and she'd start
screaming would be at the pool and she'd
scream she's burning and she wants to go
in and I'd be like we just got here what
is the problem actually I heard a bird a
bird I want to go in I can't take it and
I was like really itched a lot and it
like would turn my hands my feet really
red like if I scratch too much it would
like blister kind of and then scar
Andrea would put Savannah's hands and
bags of ice or cold bathtub nothing
would help I've taken her to the doctor
when she's been crying and going we're
here what's wrong with her
what's wrong with her they just tell me
she has eczema I'm telling them it's got
to be more than eczema you don't cry
like that from eczema for five years the
Fulkerson's had no answers until they
met dr. Minelli Lou at Children's
Hospital Los Angeles in Savannah's case
and we can see that she has developed
these red welts on her hand as well as
her fingers and this along with her
young age made dr. Lou suspect Savannah
had a rifra poetic or FIRREA also called
epp a rare and sometimes deadly disease
it was even featured on the television
show house
but could this be what was affecting
little Savannah the challenge is both
how rare the condition is as well as the
subtlety sometimes there may be some red
patches maybe some areas that look
sunburned and that can lead to a long
lag in diagnosis after years of no
answers a simple blood test finally gave
them one what did the doctors finally
tell you that um she had they don't say
here throw periodic porphyria it would
mean a lifetime sentence confined to a
world in the shadows how do you explain
this to your friends I just usually say
that I'm allergic to the Sun I can't be
out like I can never go to the beach I
can never go to a sunlit pool like I
have um literally I have to be in the
dark darks my home Savannah now 11 years
old has to wait until evening to swim in
her pool
my friends definition of a normal day in
my definition of a normal day are way
different hers is bright sunny and
beautiful mine's dark cloudy and rainy
and when she does venture out into
daylight it's an effort putting on this
UV protective clothing people have made
fun of you because of this yeah because
of like my scarred hands they called me
like old lady hands or umbrella head
because my big hat that goes around so I
don't get burned they don't understand
they don't but Savannah doesn't let that
get her down but look at your you have
such a good attitude about it
how is that possible I just try to think
positive because I know kids somewhere
else have way worse than me the family
has made adjustments for the little girl
with boundless energy you have a
trampoline in your living room who has
that not many people
not many people savannas not the only
kid living life in the shade when the
sun goes down a fun summer day is just
beginning for these one-of-a-kind
campers in New York City fantastic we
enjoying this we having fun you guys
these kids suffer from another rare
genetic skin disorder called XP any
exposure to sunlight can cause
third-degree burns and can lead to
cancer when their daughter Katie was
diagnosed with XP Dan and Karen Mayer
founded camps sundown in upstate New
York where day is night and night is day
these rare medical conditions aren't new
some scientific historians speculate
Vlad the third of Transylvania had EPP
he's believed to be the historical basis
for Dracula giving rise to vampire and
werewolf legends that continued to this
day in popular TV shows like Vampire
Diaries
[Music]
but just today new hope for savanah and
others like her a study about a drug
treatment called a family note I'd
published in the New England Journal of
Medicine with this drug you're going to
increase the melanin your skin you're
going to tan in a couple days and the
tan and the melanin will act as a safety
filter for the harmful rays of the Sun
although the study's findings are
promising the drug is only available in
Europe awaiting FDA approval here in the
states at the moment this is the only
drug that's really effective as shown by
the clinical studies what is your big
hope there's a care out there and like
kids don't have to live with this
experts say less severe forms of EPP can
occur some symptoms are redness over
areas exposed to the Sun such as the
nose the cheeks or hands there of course
many other skin conditions I can present
with exactly the same findings and so
that's where seeking attention with
either a dermatologist who specializes
in children or a porphyria specialist is
very very important I just wish I didn't
have it I wish no one had it but for
Savannah and her family the hope that
maybe one day she'll be able to feel the
Sun on her skin without pain is enough
to keep her smile it doesn't define me
like when I get older like it's not
gonna change what I want to do am I like
I'm still gonna want to have like
everything that I possibly can as like a
normal life what would that normal life
look like to you a house on the beach on
the beach a sunny beach yeah really it's
not gonna tear me down that's gonna just
build me up for nightline I'm Mattie

bubble gum
and see if this 150 bubble gum
toothbrush set will clean my stained
teeth bubble gum is actually pretty easy
to make
so let's make it you're going to start
off with gum base
these little things look like beans so
let's sweeten it up first you gotta add
a little bit of corn syrup
fat glob not too much this stuff's not
too healthy for you we gotta have it
taste a little sweet next is the tutti
fruttie flavoring so it tastes like a
disclosing tablet
now lastly the disclosing solution you
can use food coloring but i'm going to
use disclosing tablet solution to stay

fingers because this stuff is potent
i'll have pink hands for the week add
two for good luck

seconds and give it a twirl
once you get it to the right consistency
it's time to make some slices we got
some powdered sugar that we're gonna
make a little hole in the center and
then add the gum mix that glove get
every single last drop of the gum into
the center oh it's so messy cause it's
hot you're gonna fold it over and
incorporate some of the powdered sugar
until it's not too sticky smells
delicious once it's got the right
texture it's time to make some cuts
add a little bit of sugar and shape them
to how you want it i want little cubes
like hubbub now that we got our gorgeous
pieces of gum let's test them out it's
this closing time
it's so soft i think i might add too
much flavor though
i think my lips are getting more pink as
i chew i see how big of a bubble i can
blow
i think we need more gum
oh yeah my teeth are getting really pink
after chewing this gum but it tastes
pretty good i look like a chipmunk
lowest bubble i want it larger than my
face

like an alcohol smell to it that's why i
thought it was old i thought it was just
like fermented i give it a 3 out of 10.
up next is act cavity protection
it's got my favorite feature you squeeze
it and it fills to the exact line you

opinion will change as the tide comes in

twice a day this road is underwater and

potholes significantly tight twists and
turns heavy truck pedestrian and
livestock traffic and the fact that
there are very few if any guardrails and
you have one hell of a dangerous road
the icing on the cake for this

goes through some rather remote areas
where a breakdown can mean big trouble
depending on what time of day it is
second this area is known to be
patrolled by bands of criminals and
terrorists who generally strike at night
this has led many people to drive
without their headlights on at night

gorge road is widely considered to be
the country's deadliest stretch of
roadway carved into and sometimes
through the mountainous terrain this
road faces significant erosion and
landslides thanks to heavy rain and
earthquakes it has made all the more
challenging by the fact that the road is
extremely narrow in spots and has
numerous blind corners which can be full
on surprises lose control or get bumped
by another car there's a good bet you
are plummeting down the side of the

this road is deemed safest in the summer
months of March and April that's because
over the rest of the year heavy
rainfalls fog rock and mudslides can
turn this route into a nightmare
tourists braved the risks to take in the
amazing views of the landscape
unfortunately the dangerous environment
combined with the fact that tour buses
often drive far too fast on this rather

there are many crashes as vehicles hit
one another or simply roll off the edge

narrow by the standard of other roads
mentioned in this video but meeting an
oncoming vehicle can make things a bit

- Nice hose.
So one of the classic things to do in slow motion
is to do a water balloon, full of water popping,
looks cool, and we've done plenty of that over the years.
- I thought that was a pretty small balloon, though.
- It was.
That was actually a balloom only this big, stretched out.
- It was about that big when it was fully sort of.
- Get rid of that.
And, um.
Use this.
- Whoa, yes!
- So let's see how we get on, yeah?
Look how tiny that.
- Oh, god, it's stuck together.
Yeah, I'll do that.
- All right, let's move all the cameras back.
Don't you dare claw this.
Aren't you going to be in for a surprise when this pops?
I know how much you hate water.
- [Daniel] Does she hate water?
- Yeah.
All right, yeah?
That's full enough.
This is gonna suck, ready?
Ready?
- [Daniel] Yeah.
- [Daniel] Do you want me to shoot it?
It took all my weight.
This is got to make it go, if I keep doing this.
This calls for slightly more desperate measures.
- [Daniel] I'm slightly concerned about this.
I do not think this is a good idea at all.
Get back in the tree.
Jump out.
- [Female spectator] Oh, my goodness.
- Hello, gov.
- What about you?
- I'm George.
- Yeah, but what are you to me?
- I'm your brother.
- Right, should we jump on this bastard together?
- Yeah,I202 let's do it.
- I'm just gonna do this, just gonna back drop it.
